Marleyj567,xhxfbo,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:57:00,This generation of workers is the most entitled in history and the next recession is going to take them back to reality
Jordanhgyd,xhf9ij,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 12:22:59,Why is everyone bending over backwards to pretend WFH has absolutely zero downside whatsoever?
Jordanhgyd,ip079k0,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 01:02:00,Lmaooo. Had a chat with boss this morning about it actually. They are being told to come in 4 days like everyone else or look for work elsewhere. Which is fair enough given they are underperforming
dbug89,ip074dx,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 01:00:57,"Great time to bring out the computer log analysis tools, and HR ü§£."
Jordanhgyd,ip05w9l,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:52:02,Yes SaaS/Cyber
retireaus,ip05w2q,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:52:00,What does your thread title say sorry? Maybe I misread.
Jordanhgyd,ip05e5b,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:48:25,Yes the two are likely going to get fired or forced to come in because they are abusing WFH. So good result overall.
Jordanhgyd,ip057c7,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:47:05,"Wow what a genius idea, I wonder why we never thought of that. 

You seriously don‚Äôt think we tried teams, mobiles multiples times?

Why are people so eager to protect bad behaviour."
Jordanhgyd,ip04wma,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:45:00,Yea I think that‚Äôs the real secret. Most people who are devotedly in support of 100% WFH is because they can fly under the radar a lot easier and abuse the system
Jordanhgyd,ip04qgc,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:43:45,‚ÄúWork life balance‚Äù is a euphemism for ‚Äúslacking off‚Äù I‚Äôve found. Or knocking off early without telling anyone.
Jordanhgyd,ip04h9t,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:41:48,The next recession will sort these people out. We‚Äôll see how picky they can be.
Jordanhgyd,ip04bpm,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:40:38,"No, they aren‚Äôt frustrating when present. No issues before we went WFH.

I suspect they are away from the computer most of the day."
Jordanhgyd,ip047e6,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:39:44,I have been and the entire team reported the two slackers who will need to come in or get the boot as they are negatively affecting us.
Jordanhgyd,ip041fk,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:38:28,"I don‚Äôt drink either, but I usually go to drinks. No one ever pressures you to drink alcohol. I always have a soft drink as a nice treat. Being social won‚Äôt kill you."
Jordanhgyd,ip03p6h,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:35:57,In the US they are already outsourcing high paid jobs. Aussies think they are so special that their job simply couldn‚Äôt ever be outsourced.
Jordanhgyd,ip03kxu,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:35:05,It‚Äôs so odd how offended some of you get :)
Jordanhgyd,ip03fr3,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:34:02,Yikes.
Jordanhgyd,ip035b5,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:31:52,And he said ‚Äúno one‚Äù. Perhaps work on your comprehension?
Calm_trader,ip0116q,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:15:59,"I love WFH. Having to deal w idiots all day long, going from wasteful meeting to meeting , and getting in early and staying late just to ‚Äòshow face‚Äô - so over it all."
retireaus,ip00jlt,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:12:17,"Two people = ""everyone"" got it"
AwakE432,iozzrx0,fiaustralia,2022-09-19 00:06:36,Why do you give a shit about what other peoples options are about wfh? You have an opinion and others have a different opinion. No right it wrong it‚Äôs personal preference.
Top_Chemical_7350,iozvepj,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 23:34:37,"I like the genie analogy. Anecdotally from peers and from own experience, if a role is advertised as 100% in office, then it‚Äôs a hard no. 

This is a clear working culture shift and I‚Äôm absolutely here for it."
YouGoodOrNah,ioztwmp,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 23:23:34,"I had zero problem working in the office, and had a lot of the same issues you did.  It was hard for me to train staff, it was hard to form relationships, it was hard to collaborate, etc‚Ä¶

Then I left my company and joined a fully remote company and it is 100% on my old company as to why things were hard.  My new company is focused on making WFH work.  

We have in person gatherings for the entire company and for individual teams.  So we meet in person usually once a quarter or more.  The benefit being it‚Äôs usually at some high end hotel and everything is paid for including good dinner and drinks.

Collaboration is much easier when you have to include remote people and the technology supports it.

Training may be one challenge, but technology solves it. We also don‚Äôt hire entry level, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about teaching people learning new concepts entirely."
niloony,iozshqt,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 23:13:16,This is the downside I've found. As an entry level I feel like I'm probably learning at about half the speed I would be in the office since the rest of my team is in another city and we're all too socially awkward.
DegenerateBuildoor,iozps1h,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 22:53:52,"Ah yes, another boomer complaining about wfh reducing productivity because they don‚Äôt know how to work remotely effectively. 

Sounds like a you issue."
Top_Chemical_7350,ioznp4s,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 22:40:04,"To me, this sounds like a poorly thought out ploy to get people back to the office. 
I would bet money that after a year or so, the policy would be scrapped. 

My work are offering ‚Äúrandom door prizes‚Äù and food/ coffee vouchers. Most people see straight through it and continue 1 to 2 days of office and 3 to 4 home."
Top_Chemical_7350,iozmbb2,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 22:30:32,"Sorry OP this ain‚Äôt it. 
I‚Äôm flex/ WFH. I am on my home desk getting work done at 8 (would normally be on a bus 07:45 - 8:30) and I leave at 5. 

I get so much more done work-wise and in my personal life. I‚Äôm getting more sleep. I‚Äôm fitter, the house is cleaner and I spend more time with my partner who I love. 

Tell your team mates to be more attentive to their messages and keep raising it with management if they persist. They are being dicks."
razzij,iozkibb,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 22:18:19,"Hyperbole much? ""Everyone"" is not ""bending over backwards"" to ""pretend"" there is ""absolutely zero downside"". There are pros and cons, and different models work for different people and different organisations. Get over it."
Fit_Day_3580,iozjtx8,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 22:13:32,"My note of caution...if you can do your job from home, it can be done from Manilla, Suva, Jakarta, Durban, Bejing etc etc.....we are already seen an acceleration in this shift.  I know of at least three ASX top 300 businesses whose strategy over the next three years is to shift staff from Aus to overseas.  No redundancy just replace as turnover happens.  I do think this will continue to accelerate and it feels a bit like the boiled frog."
Spiniferus,iozgu8u,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 21:53:25,A blend of both is good. I‚Äôd rather work from home for lack of travel time (I get more work time and personal time).. but what I miss is those water cooler conversations where you impromptu spitball ideas. I‚Äôm primarily an introvert but have bursts of extraversion and often I will feel energised from being around people. Also as a leader it is important to see and be seen.. one of my strongest gauges of whether my staff are struggling with wellbeing/over load or not is face to face engagement where you can assess body language.. much harder virtually.
terrychanzel,iozezwh,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 21:41:31,"As someone who chooses not to drink it‚Äôs actually really refreshing not to get forced into obligatory beer sessions after work. I get measured on my output being remote, not on how many drinks I threw back with the boss. Sometimes ‚Äúsocialising‚Äù is simply overrated both in terms of benefit to the business and the individual."
sunflowerdaisymoon,iozd61z,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 21:29:33,"Regarding point #1, I'm the youngest in my team and I'm 29 while everyone else is over 40. All they talk about is their kids and I find it really hard to find something in common with them. They are good colleagues but are not my friends. 

Regarding point #2 I've not had an issue with collaboration while WFH and I am working on a project. I find meetings are more productive on Teams as you don't have to deal with and try and work out the different technology set up in each meeting room to be able to share your screen. You also don't have to walk around your building trying to find the room and as a result be late to the meeting if you have back to back meetings"
ribbonsofnight,iozc0u0,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 21:22:03,on the other hand you only seem to be capable of expecting everyone to be exactly like you. Makes you a lot like OP.
saffyskaf,ioz8bf9,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 20:58:22,Why do you care what other people do? If other people are more comfortable wfh then let them be. Just do your job and mind your own business.
rplej,ioz61u0,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 20:44:36,But are these the same people who are frustrating to work with in the office?
Current_Inevitable43,ioz3qxe,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 20:30:33,"What i don't get is people were employed as office based now things are going back to normal people are going noooope this leeway we had during during the pandemic was great I'm redlfusjlhing to go back.

Saying it saves 2hrs of travel a day is no one but your problem for choosing employment that far away from your place.

Alot of other fields had relaxations in face to face training or other percs such as taking work cars home and heading straight to job site. They are not in an uproar now they need to speed money on petrol to go to work then hop in a work car. 

If you are employed as office staff be grateful that you got some WFH then carry on and go back to your office.

If you were employed as WFH and the balance has changed outside of what is allowed then complain. But most people got some favourable percs and want to keep them for ever."
EuphoricBase9737,ioz2twf,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 20:24:53,"OP makes it seem like people who work from home are lonely and have mental health issues and are socially disadvantaged. Not the case at all. I catch up with my work mates on teams and book on those catch-ups proactively. I have a lot of friends outside of work. I just don't like the office bullshit. The pretence, the commute, wasting my time dressing up for the day. I just want to work, get my job done and not deal with politics."
TheFrogTutorial,ioz2jjf,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 20:23:07,"Of course there are pros and cons. There are pro and cons to literally ever decision you make. However,  there are very few situations where WFH is worse than in office. Work/life balance positives are hard to beat."
EuphoricBase9737,ioz2e9q,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 20:22:12,WFH doesn't mean you don't socialise or make an effort to socialise. It just means it's not with your work colleagues who most of the time you can't be authentically 100 percent you because you want to uphold a certain work image.
EuphoricBase9737,ioz1ugk,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 20:18:51,Definitely doesn't have kids haha! They'll be singing a different tune about WFH if and when they do.
EuphoricBase9737,ioz1m7z,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 20:17:27,"I üíØ percent agree. I'm a very social person and build relationships quite easily and am well liked across most places I work at. I can also count on one hand the number of people I am still in contact with after I've left the company.

Working from home is by the far the best thing that's happened to me since COVID. I've moved interstate, I can drop my kids off later to daycare. Pick them up earlier. 

Im highly responsive on MS TEAMS and my project team never have a problem collaborating with me. My manager works from home, in fact most of my team do even though there's an office."
Esquatcho_Mundo,ioz1g9o,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 20:16:25,"Here‚Äôs the thing, wfh is absolutely better for the majority of people. But it‚Äôs generally worse for business productivity overall, with studies generally showing that the more hours working from home, the improvements start getting eroded. Mentoring of new staff or young people has taken a dive too.

Mental health is much harder to manage when isolated too.

I think for many office jobs we will see hybrid more commonly and those that wfh will likely be at a disadvantage in their career compared to those in the office (rightly or wrongly). Exception to this are those in high demand jobs, those that don‚Äôt need collaboration or working in global jobs where things have always been remote."
Specialist_Leg_92,ioyxim5,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 19:52:35,Not to mention the people who are unproductive and not even really working. Those people need to be in an office environment with someone looking over their shoulder
Ok-Book5357,ioyv8nh,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 19:39:08,"No negatives for WFH in my situation. I save out on several hours of commute each day which I can spend being with family more, sleeping a bit more, eating more healthy, and getting some exercise done. Also my productivity has climbed and I get more work done. Boss is happy with me staying fully WFH (for now)"
everyelmer,ioyerxr,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 17:59:19,I think one of the key parts of ‚ÄúFI‚Äù is the ‚Äòindependent‚Äô aspect. When it comes from an inheritance‚Ä¶
JamesFlemming,ioy5hgc,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 17:02:00,"\&gt; When everyone else is trying to collaborate or get their input on their   
leg of work it‚Äôs impossible to get ahold of them. They will sometimes   
not respond for hours and it makes things extremely clunky.

Ring their mobiles."
Thick_Koala_3902,ioxo6lk,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 15:07:53,"Point 1: sounds like a ""you"" issue. People shouldn't be forced to socialise with work colleagues. It is work. I've been in both situations where I've worked at companies where I enjoyed coming in and socialising with my colleagues and other places just not fit in or despised the people around me and wished I'd have had the option to WFH.

Point 2: is a fair point, but that sounds like you have workers who are the problem. In my experience everyone understands the privilege of WFH so it's pretty easy to get a hold of 90% of colleagues within a reasonable time. It really depends on the workplace and type of work being done. And as such each company and team within that company should be looking to see what is organically best for each team (no a one size fits all approach) but have leaders at the helm to readjust policy if needed - and be open to it. If companies are able to do what it takes to cut their costs, so should the workers."
Nahmateyeahmate,ioxg36j,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 14:10:58,"I got hired for my first corporate 'career' job in the height of the pandemic and it was a nightmare trying to learn everything over teams and video chats. Even the people who were experienced in my team were struggling with it, I was miserable trying to learn the ropes from home. Killed all my motivation for something I studied pretty passionately at uni and eventually told the boss that I couldn't do it anymore. There are heaps of benefits and if you're comfortable in your role it can be awesome but the downsides are definitely there"
Jordanhgyd,ioxftht,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 14:08:59,"You sound incredibly happy, having to flaunt your FI status.

And FYI, I‚Äôm also FI fortunately but due to inheritance. Learn to stay humble."
parlllay,ioxf2ds,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 14:03:17,"sigh... good luck achieving FI, turns out you WFH is getting in the way of that for you."
KD--27,ioxdx76,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:54:30,"First of all - your time means absolutely nothing. I have experience. If I can get my job done in half the time, you can pay me double because I‚Äôm a rockstar at what I do, and that junior over there that clocks all their hours isn‚Äôt about to earn double for taking twice as long. I get paid for the job I do, not the procrastination it took me to get there. 

You need to lose your mindset bud. One day it will click that being paid to sit, even if that‚Äôs on a train - is time you are losing that‚Äôs far more valuable than a few dollars."
Jordanhgyd,ioxdnj7,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:52:27,"If you read my post it wasn‚Äôt just me, it was the entire team passing that feedback on.

No one is being thrown under the bus. If you‚Äôre non responsive, despite repeated feedback what do you expect us to do? Allow them to not do their work, have the projects delayed and we all take the flack?

It seems to me like you want the rest of us to cover for poor performance."
sickeasement,ioxd45p,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:48:24,Great job throwing your 2 coworkers who WFH under the bus because it doesn't work for you? What a massive dickhead.
Mother_Village9831,ioxd3oj,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:48:18,"If the workplace is happy with the produced work, and it takes me 20 hours, and they value it at 40 hours, what's the problem? Should that worker stuff around to pad out time?"
JaseLZS,ioxd1hf,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:47:50,I think OP is quite young. Once he has spent a couple years in the corporate environment he‚Äôll understand.
tothemoonandback01,ioxcyqe,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:47:16,"The question of ""company culture"" is coming up now.  Expect more of this in the future,  as some managers are afraid of losing that ""special glue"" that binds the company."
Mother_Village9831,ioxcr49,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:45:42,It's amazing you assume people who WFH aren't doing that as well.
Marleyj567,ioxcow8,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:45:15,The same cobbas that complain of no wage growth and no promotions. They‚Äôre entitled weirdos who live online and not in the real world.
Jordanhgyd,ioxcibb,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:43:54,"Ok, well if your work on a regular basis truly can be done in 4 hours a day, would you then accept your work place paying you a contract of 20 hours a week?"
Jordanhgyd,ioxcaqu,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:42:19,"My apologies that you feel that way, I feel that I have been considerate to everyone‚Äôs opinion.

But it‚Äôs also inconsiderate for people taking the piss out of work while the rest of us are working hard to meet deadlines and produce high quality work."
Jordanhgyd,ioxc38z,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:40:44,"I think that‚Äôs perhaps a unique experience to you. I‚Äôm still friends with people I worked with stocking shelves at the grocery store at age 14. I‚Äôm still friends with at last 1 person from everywhere I‚Äôve worked. And by friends I mean we chat online and meet up on a varying basis. Same with uni, same with friends I made while on exchange for a semester."
Mother_Village9831,ioxc2qj,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:40:38,"If you can do the appropriate amount of work at home, why is that not good enough?"
Daddysosa,ioxc0m7,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:40:10,"You mean the reddit hivemind of introverted left-wing weirdos don't like socialising at work.

Mother_Village9831,ioxbq2y,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:37:47,"The push from the top end of town to get workers back in offices has less to do with productivity and more with the value of commercial property these offices inhabit.

Marleyj567,ioxbgmq,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:35:38,"And looking through your post/comment history I hit the nail right on the head.

Poor guy."
Josiah_Walker,ioxbfom,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:35:25,"My work is hybrid/remote, but there are core hours where everybody is expected to respond when contacted. I value the tiem spent with colleagues, but as a parent with young kinds (who often give me a cold that I don't want to communicate to my office) it's actually better for the team to have a more flexible work arrangement. It sounds like your workplace is still feeling its way through how to work well remotely - feedback is an essential part of that. Just make sure to be sensitive to allowing for off-site work when it benefits all involved."
Hypo_Mix,ioxbfax,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:35:20,There is a few studies out there showing that full WFH can have negative impacts on mental health due to isolation and lack of direction.
Mother_Village9831,ioxb983,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 13:34:03,I think a lot of people overestimate work friendships. I've gotten along with a lot of people across 5 workplaces in my present occupation.

I can take a quick nap to recharge and be back to 100% within 15 minutes.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Solution 1 is to sell the property as part of the estate BEFORE it is transferred - would need to sell almost immediately to meet the time frame. The estate would get the 50% CGT discount and is taxed as an individual for the first 3 years following death. If transferred then sold, you could not utilise the 50% CGT discount or the main residence exemption (if applicable - an inherited property is exempt from CGT if you dispose of it within 2 years of the deceased's death).

**If they want to hold it, yes there will be land tax.**

In addition to regular land tax, NSW imposes an additional 'Foreign Owner Surcharge land tax'. The rate is four per cent from the 2023 land tax year onwards. The regular land tax rate is $100 plus 1.6 per cent of land value above the threshold of $822,000. 

This means, on 2mil of land, you would be up for \~19k of regular PLUS \~40K surcharge for a WHOPPING \~60k PER YEAR.

Foreign Owner Surcharge land tax is not applicable to Aus citizens. But is applicable to PRs in most cases.

As joint holdings and single holdings are taxed the same in NSW, one solution would be to transfer it only into your mum's name. Saving you 40k per year. However, the main con with this option is that when sold, 100% of the CGT would be attributable to your mum, which may lead to more tax than splitting 50/50 with your dad, but definitely cheaper than 40k per year.

big_cock_lach,iowb2we,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 07:02:07,"Balanced includes ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù investments which protect wealth. Given you‚Äôre 32 and you don‚Äôt retire until 65 at the earliest, you don‚Äôt need to protect wealth, you need to build it. Any short term crashes become insignificant over 35 years. For example, look at the S&amp;P500 index, the last recession you can actually notice is the dot com bubble. Even that doesn‚Äôt seem to significant, if you invested at the peak of that crash, you‚Äôd still be up around 3x. That‚Äôs about a 400% increase over about 20 years.

Once you get older, you‚Äôd want to start having more defensive assets to protect your wealth. Why? Because if you‚Äôre 60 and there‚Äôs a crash, you probably won‚Äôt regain that wealth again within 5 years. Meaning, you won‚Äôt be able to retire on the lifestyle you planned to. If you want to get clever, you can try to time the market and switch around the bottom so that you don‚Äôt eat up as many losses. However, people are notoriously horrible at this and it will likely backfire so I‚Äôd advise against it.

The real question should be: should I invest in international shares, Australian shares, or both? Index, for super at least, is better. I‚Äôd say unhedged for you would be better as well since for long-term investments you don‚Äôt need to hedge against currencies and thus you would be ‚Äúpaying‚Äù extra for no reason. However, once this time frame reduces, you‚Äôd want to start hedging a bit more."

**Direct residential property investing**

The stock market is pretty efficient, so you're going to have a tough time beating it, and as such, just buying the entire market to guarantee the average market returns is often the most efficient way to invest.

The residential property market is inefficient, which means if you know what you're doing, there are more opportunities to do better than the market average. The flip side of this is that if you don't, you have more opportunity to do *worse* than the market average.

Then there is the lack of diversification with an enormous amount of your wealth in a single asset in one location. It's virtually impossible to diversify through multiple property types, markets, and countries, so if you pick the wrong one or have a bit of bad luck, your total wealth can take a massive hit.

Further to the problem of a lack of diversification is that you already have an enormous amount of your wealth in direct residential property if you own your own home. Purchasing further direct property is going to increase your concentration risk even further.

There are also never-ending problems with tenants, incompetent property managers, changing tax laws.

Then, of course, there's the illiquidity. If you need to cash some of it in, you can't just sell a door or a window, so cash flow requirements are a problem. Another consequence of the illiquidity is that to sell any of it, you need to sell it all, and your CGT bill cannot be spread over multiple years. Consequently, it drives your tax bracket through the roof for most of your profit. Not to mention, when you do want to sell, it takes months.

Direct residential property investment isn't necessarily a *bad* investment; it's just that it takes a specific set of skills. If you understand the property cycle, economic cycle, the market you're looking to invest in, have enough information and experience to take into account all of the variables, and a willingness for the work required, these market inefficiencies can work in your favour. The problem comes in for those who are looking for passive investment while you focus on other things in your life, such as family or building a career or business."

To those saying we lived under higher interest rates and did not see rents as high, the absolute level of interest rates is not what matters. It's from where those interest rates have recently come. The interest rate being forced so low by the RBA's money printing is what lead to the fewest household members in each property ever reported.

However, examples of indirect effect:
- rising interest rate means people who ordinarily would buy in the near term have their borrowing capacity reduced due to fallen serviceability. _Some_ of them may no longer be able or willing to buy, contributing to incrementally greater rental demand.
- rising interest rate means _some_ landlords may eventually consider that their IP is no longer desirable financially and choose to sell.

nzbiggles,iolnada,fiaustralia,2022-09-16 00:07:25,"Working to achieve 25 x is FIRE unnecessarily delayed in my opinion. People frequently don't start planning retirement until the late 30s early 40s and many work much longer than they need to amass a balance they won't consume.  Once you own your own home 300k in super and the pension is a pretty amazing safety net. People think outside super only and for life before 67 but they also need to factor in super and allow that the pension will exist. Efficiently use the entire system to reduce your time working. 

Everyone's fire journey is different and valid for them. Even consuming a bit more now if it means 1 year longer working can have value. No point spending your 40s and 50s living like a monk.

Kementarii,iollvlr,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 23:56:24,"As someone who had no hope of getting anywhere near 800k in super, I'm following the sweet spot.

Retired at 60, access Super tax-free. By the time I get to 67, my super balance will be reduced, and income will be topped up with the Age Pension.

My only other option was to keep working, never have enough in Super to be self-funded, but by 67, too much to get an age pension. At the same time, there's 7 years of life gone by."
WadingThrough01,iolby91,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 22:40:27,"With your time frame being 15 years bringing you perfectly to the preservation / super access age of 60, then it'd make sense to maximise all you can into super from a purely financial point of view.

bundle_of_fun,iol4buz,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 21:46:08,"You mean 60. And if OP is talking about only accessing its income from 60, that aligns well with when you can access super."

I work backwards. Sort super then focus on bridging the gap. It might be your super balance won't sustain you post 60 so investing in vdhg hasn't achieved anything but if you get to 50 and your super is predicted to be enough you can focus on vdhg for money to retire before then. Even if you're 59 it might mean as little as 1 year in cash ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

People talk about 25 x living in expenses as a target investment pool but this could be impossible for some on their 50s and 60s. The question is what gives the best outcome. Super is tax free for investment returns under the balance transfer cap. Considering this you might only need 22 times (18 in super and 4 out) especially if you're 58. Another thing to consider is someone with 800k in super at 67 is no better off than someone with 270k in super as the pension offers significant support. So if you're 64 and can access super and you have 3 years expenses out and 300k in you could retire burn your 3 years and take the pensions/super sweet spot. No point working 3 more years!

Commsec I believe charges you certain amount for brokerage (need to check their website as they have variable brokerage cost for certain amount i believe)

glyptometa,ioicv8l,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 09:32:17,"Bonds have significant further potential downside, with interest rates likely to keep on climbing, so that leaves interest on cash to reduce the erosion coming from inflation.

Ok-Individual9753,ioi7ixs,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 08:13:25,"Given that inflation is at a shockingly high number at the moment, both fixed interest and cash options for most super funds will fail to even keep pace with inflation. Since you have at least a 7 year investment horizon before you can withdraw or touch your super, you may have to look at a mix where you have exposure to equities even at a very small percentage (say 10%).

Living_Nose435,iozokm8,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 22:45:52,Thank you for your detailed reply. I guess on the face of it our risk tolerance is higher at the moment in some regards (long time to invest and good emotional fortitude) but we have some issues with things like income protection (don‚Äôt qualify due to medical conditions). I‚Äôm also about to start my own business which will inevitably lead to inconsistent cash flow initially!. Lots to consider and I appreciate your thoughts. This sub has been very useful and knowledgeable.
A_Healthy_Distrust,iovyioi,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 04:37:51,"Whether to borrow to invest depends on your risk tolerance, so only you can answer that question (or potentially with the help of an adviser if need be).

In general, you have a higher risk tolerance when:

* you have a longer time to invest (generally an absolute minimum of 10 years to grow untouched in the case of borrowing to invest); and
* where you have the emotional fortitude to not freak out and sell when the market takes a dump and falls and the total value of your investment less debt may be below zero. you need to be able to leave it invested for the long term (including during panic-periods) in order to get the long-term average historical return.
* with regards to borrowing to invest, you also need to make sure you can meet the cashflow, which means things like income protection insurance in case of injury or illness, and a cash buffer in case of job loss."
Living_Nose435,iomh2wc,fiaustralia,2022-09-16 04:01:34,So I guess the broader question is: Debt Recycling vs Borrow to Invest- if you don‚Äôt have a ‚Äòworthwhile‚Äô lump sum of cash to do pure debt recycling or it will take a terribly long time to save one is it better to borrow to invest instead of go through pure debt recycling in 5-7 years time by the time you save a lump sum worthy of the process?

FreeLog1166,ioi87so,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 08:23:27,"Just check that nothing happens if your LVR dips below a certain level. E.g. you bought with a 85:15 LVR, your house has gone up 105k so your LVR is now 70:30. The bank will let you borrow a further 100k up to an LVR of 85:15, if your house value goes down (which given your in a market which had a spike and a lot of those markets are now trending down), you don't want to be in a situation where you need to refinance or the for some reason the bank does a valuation in 12 mths time and you have to sell shares to pay off some of the loan to get back to an 85:15 LVR.

Also what others have said, the low interest rates we've seen are a past decade phenomenon. Ray Dalio made a LI post that his bet was for rates to stay around 4/5 percent for the mid to long term and equities to dip 20 percent. There's a lot of noise going around but I think no matter where you sit the next 10 years are uncertain so you should make sure you can service the loan assuming little growth in equities and a 5 percent long term interest rate so you're not out on the st if the bears are right."
A_Healthy_Distrust,ioi70ix,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 08:06:04,"Yea.

With debt recycling, you are effectively taking some money you have ready to invest, and instead of investing it, you send it on a detour to pay down non-deductible debt and then pull it out before investing. So you are not actually increasing the total amount of debt that is bearing interest.

In your position, you can do that easily by 

1. paying down into your main loan (or putting in an offset for flexibility)
2. pull it out of the redraw in the new loan split that you created when you pulled out equity

And yes, you can easily do this with amounts as small as you like (e.g. pay down 1k into loan #1, and draw out 1k from loan #2).

DCA = dollar cost averaging = investing small amounts regularly.

If you did not have enough equity to pull out, you would need to pay down a lump sum and go through the pain of dealing with the bank to pull that equity out each time."
JacobAldridge,ioi62g4,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 07:52:45,"I think a 6% upper end for the current cycle is reasonable, as are 10% nominal returns on a long term average (including dividend reinvestment).

That‚Äôs not a huge margin for error - just depends how comfortable you are when interest in the debt has to be paid for AND there‚Äôs always a short term chance your shares could be worth 10-20% less than what you paid for them (and therefore what you owe on them)."

longstreakof,ioi4pfp,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 07:33:34,The big assumption is that shares will go up. There are a lot of risks in the markets at the moment and I don't think anyone has seen such a complex set of problems all happening at the same time.  I listened to an economist yesterday he he described it as a perfect storms of perfect storms.     I don't disagree with the accountants thoughts on rates but if rates are going to reverse and go down - what has caused that and what would the share market be doing under those conditions?  My Guess is not so well and that could be the right time to do what you are saying.   Maybe wait a bit.
Living_Nose435,ioi3id4,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 07:16:46,"Awesome ok. What does DCA mean? 

Yes we‚Äôve been lucky in that the value of our home which we‚Äôve only owed for 14 months has gone up $105k; plus what we‚Äôve paid off means we have a lump equity at this point to play with. 

With this method would you just keep drawing out smaller lumps (eg. $5k) if/when you have them? In perpetuity?"
A_Healthy_Distrust,ioi20oa,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 06:57:03,"Yeah, it is technically borrowing to invest, but what can be done is

1. Borrow say 200k (or whatever) into a loan split #2 (split #1 is the main home loan that is non-deductible)
2. You have 5k to invest
3. Draw 5k out of the redraw in split #2 and invest
4. Put your 5k into the main loan split #1 (or into an offset against it if wanting to keep flexibility)

Technically, yes you are borrowing to invest, but in terms of total debt generating interest and the proportion between deductible and non-deductible, it is what you would get with debt recycling.

This way is much easier and flexible, and allows you to effectively debt recycle with frequent DCA amounts.

The main reason not to do it this way is if you don't have the equity that you can pull from your loan in the first place (not everyone does)."

I did question him about interest rates and he said two things - one; that interest rates will peak at about 5.5 maybe six if we‚Äôre unlucky and then head back exactly the way they came, and two, even if we get to 5.5/6% that‚Äôs still worse than a 10 to 12% return on investment in shares over the long term -what are your thoughts on this"
JacobAldridge,iohyxaa,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 06:17:35,"You could do that. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúdebt recycling‚Äù, because that‚Äôs a concept specifically related to having cash to pay-down-and-reborrow rather than simply invest.

What the accountant is suggesting is ‚Äúborrowing to invest‚Äù. Key difference - when you borrow to invest, you end up with more debt, unlike debt recycling where your debt level remains the same.

Borrowing to invest is a reasonable strategy, though riskier when mortgage interest rates are heading for 5%+ than when they were 1.99%. Chances are you‚Äôd be negatively geared with your share portfolio."

longstreakof,ioi0mox,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 06:39:02,I don't mind your idea of house but think about where you buy.   IMO there are major risks with building at the moment.   Land prises are high and building costs are high.  Both are likely to plummet as housing construction is expected to fall off a cliff (after building approvals already dropped to very low levels).  Local house prises in these areas that have land releases are closely linked to the cost of a new home so I feel the place of least risk is an established suburb.

market_theory,iohkf13,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 03:45:47,Question doesn't make sense. FIREees are capital holders so the higher the returns on capital the better for them. In the current environment they might rebalance from equity to debt.
NerdfromtheBurg,ioh527q,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 01:42:25,"And we remix the portfolio to a more conservative (cash or cash equivalent) balance as we get closer to retirement (less time to recover from a heavy loss) so higher cash rates are preferred. Flip side -covid was tough - cash TDs rolled from 5% down to 1.3% so big loss of income, and equity payouts also reduced. But a robust portfolio weathers these storms. The benefit of diversity and patience is long term gain."

SofiePebbles,xef5oz,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 22:20:41,Managing overseas property portfolio
redditsilvaa,iow4bvw,fiaustralia,2022-09-18 05:40:42,"If I were you, I would consider opening a LLC prior to inheriting said properties overseas and put the ownership of the asset in the name of the LLC. In effect you will not be the owner of the asset for tax purposes and in general, tax on any income generated by the company (i.e., from rental of the properties) is generally cheaper (at least this is the case in Brazil). Of course there's fees involved in establishing the company to begin with, with the benefit will likely outweigh the cost in the long run. To fund your retirement in Australia, you would then distribute dividends from the LLC to Australia (via [wise.com](https://wise.com) for example). Consider doing this once your income in Australia is low enough that you're not subject to the higher tax brackets - your call at the end of the day. Just my two cents :)"
SofiePebbles,iohtysf,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 05:19:51,Thank you for the wise.com recommendation. Will look into it

market_theory,ioh09au,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 01:06:18,The most tax efficient thing to do is not tell the ATO. This will also greatly simplify your affairs.
Mr_Bob_Ferguson,iogxp5f,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 00:47:12,"You have multiple complications.

- Assets owned overseas
- Rental money going to other people for property you own
- International transfers of funds

Absolutely seek professional advice."
detrimental12,iogvfhg,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 00:30:19,"It depends on the country they are in and if that country has a tax treaty with Australia. If they don't then you will likely be paying tax in the country where the properties are based + you will be paying tax in Australia on the same income.

Managing the money will be easier in a bank account in the same country. In case your properties are in the US, you will need to physically be in the country to open a bank account (based on the US Patriot Act / Freedom Act created after 9/11).

The best way to transfer large funds from overseas to Australia is using a wholesale company. I've had good experience with wise.com. Fun fact, always call them and they will give you an even better rate over the phone.

All of this to say, you will need to seek professional advice from an accountant, ideally one in Australia that also specialises in the country these properties are in."
iceysteps,xedyqs,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 21:32:35,Rookie Q re super contributions Vs ETFs
longstreakof,iolpc9v,fiaustralia,2022-09-16 00:23:22,Super still is a good option even if it is taxed higher but it is very useful to have investments outside of super too.  There are very tax effective funds out there but you need to hold for 10 years.  You can also add to them but you have to not miss a year as you can only add 125% of what you did the previous year.
YeYeNenMo,ioilypa,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 11:22:31,Max out super„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇthen ETF
Mr_Bob_Ferguson,iohs2mj,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 04:59:30,"The ‚Äúcan‚Äôt access until 60‚Äù also needs to be weighed up against your current financial position.

If you are already comfortable and have everything under control, no plans to upgrade houses etc, then super may make more sense.

If you‚Äôre still establishing family arrangements and housing, then things can change quickly and you may desire to have access to those funds to help secure a new property etc."
financefiendAU,ioh172o,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 01:13:22,"Brilliant response üëå
Only other consideration I'd put to OP, is the lack of access that you have to super vs investments in ETFs that you detail. If you're investing for 5-7 years in an index fund and need that money then, you'd probs be better off there. If you are closer to 60 or don't need the funds for the long term until then, then super makes a lot of dollars (and sense). Keep at it üôå"
Comfortable-Part5438,iogc9ys,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 22:02:58,"For me this question comes down to more, do you want to retire before you can access your super? If so, do you have enough outside super to retire when you want to?  If the answer is yes then no, it doesn't make sense.  If it is yes and yes, its more complicated and I'll leave that to others."
3rdslip,iogbubl,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 21:59:44,"Super access is less than 17 years away if you‚Äôre 43. That‚Äôs not a long time.

Look up carry forward concessional contributions‚Ä¶ at the very least try and take advantage of that."
CalderandScale,iogagjx,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 21:49:43,"If you are liable for div293 tax, then concessional contributions to super are taxed at 30% instead of 15% which isn't ideal.
But it's still less than the top marginal tax rate of 47% so there is still some benefit.

2 other reasons are:

Growth within super is taxed less. Earnings are taxed at 15% compared to 47% if you were to invest in your own name.

Once you reach withdrawal age, your super can change from accumulation to pension, which means that all growth (and unrealised capital gains for direct holdings) are not taxed at all, up to a balance of 1.7m."
balagachchy,xe0zt4,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 12:42:15,Should I stop buying VDHG and only buy VGS? I think the Australian Equities are too high and will hurt me tax-wise in the long run
FireLN,iomx1cg,fiaustralia,2022-09-16 07:04:56,I am 40% Aus shares.
balagachchy,iomwaff,fiaustralia,2022-09-16 06:55:13,"Whats your allocation for Australian Shares to International?

Im thinking 20/80."
balagachchy,iomw7cu,fiaustralia,2022-09-16 06:54:07,That's all true. Sometimes I wonder what if America has had its time and their share market won't perform as well into the future but then Im like with our 4 banks and mining companies there's a higher chance Australian share market won't do as well lol.
FireLN,iolig80,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 23:29:41,"I could be the only one that thinks this... But yes as Australians we tend to be overweight in our own nations stock market. 
However in my mind this is not bad, we live there, we earn money there, we spend money there. 
Investing in the Australian Market means our corporations have access to more capital to invest in products and services. 
I believe this is good for us.

I also believe in investing in international markets as well."
zircosil01,iol4puv,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 21:48:49,If you are adding investments or sectors then its OK; I did that recently by adding US small cap; what you want to avoid is constantly adjusting your portfolio allocations based on recent performance - that's when it'll negatively affect your returns.
FlatFire,iokwrmb,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 20:54:30,Home bias and risk is more important than tax. Your job is in aus. Your house if you have one. Your cash savings. You don't want all of your investments there too.
balagachchy,ioj81ms,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 14:19:20,Is it bad to change the allocation as you go along? Im think of going 80-20 International to Australian Shares but then once Im comfortable and ready making 10% of my portfolio to be of emerging or specific sectors as I go along.
zircosil01,ioixvtv,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 13:06:23,"Yeah it's a good strategy to shift your portfolio to your desired allocations. One of the big keys that will  help particularly as you are young is once you've locked in an allocation it's to stay the course. In my portfolio I have five allocations of various percentages; my spread sheet pulls in the latest data and calculates out the weightings, then tells me which one is lowest from the target allocation and how much to invest. I wish I had set that up years ago."
journeytoba2022,ioi1131,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 06:44:10,What platform do you use for VGS?
AndyS1967,iohhw2u,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 03:23:42,"That's exactly what I've just done.     Australian Shares have had a great run lately, but I feel there are bargains to be had on the global stage (Nasdaq down something 20-25% for the year).  


I'll DCA into VGS for few years now I think, with an occasional dip into VAS, and VSO."
balagachchy,iohfjn4,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 03:03:58,"Yeh 20-25% is around about what Im hoping to hold in Australia. I think I will just buy VGS for the foreseeable future and once the Australian equities in my portfolio which is included in the VDHG part becomes around 15%, I will start buying VAS/A200 to lift it up to about 20%. What do you think?"
EdLovecock,ioh3uay,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 01:33:17,"Well the extra 100 companies it has in a tiny % of VAS so very little difference there or to be gained. I didn't want to be with just one ETF provider as well, I know it's a tiny thing but I felt at the time. 

In truth it was several years ago so I don't remember everything that lead to them 2 ETFs but it's worth going to their website and comparing what's in them and fees and so on."
ceriusmoon,iogzy1y,fiaustralia,2022-09-15 01:03:58,What made you choose A200 over VAS? Was it just a matter of lower fees or were there other reasons
EdLovecock,iogk4mo,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 23:03:07,I went for a 70/30 VGS/A200 and not VDHG for much the reasons you outlined and it's cheaper fees too.
zircosil01,ioggogi,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 22:36:26,"it's a reasonable strategy if you want to reduce your exposure to Australian equities. VDHG and DHHF hold too much AU for me, so I build my own portfolio to get my AU equities to 20% of my portfolio. You could hold 60% VDHG and 40% VGS to drop your AU to 20% instead of 36%"
murciefan45,iofzgsa,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 20:33:24,I'm all in VGS
HumanSeagull69,ioerxi4,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 15:47:59,Valid point and building on it - American companies (especially the tech ones that dominate the indexes) tend to reinvest more than Australian companies. This lowers their reported profit (and their tax bill) and raises their P/E metric.
Nobody-Visible,ioe8l6g,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 13:40:36,Your plan makes sense to me. Go for it
YeYeNenMo,ioe634z,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 13:23:01,Im all in VAS
totallynotalt345,ioe1pvc,fiaustralia,2022-09-14 12:49:25,"VGS has a much higher price / earnings ratio. But it also has much higher earnings growth. It‚Äôs also had a huge run in recent years, it‚Äôs way up.

VAS has a low price vs earnings, but its earning growth is under half of VGS. It‚Äôs spiked but not as much as US shares.

So‚Ä¶ VAS is clearly better value. But VGS are companies growing much faster, which therefore could be worth a lot more later. VAS has a lot of ‚Äúpeaked companies‚Äù. Both serve their purpose."

**ASX to edge down as Fed mulls mega rise**

Australian shares are poised to dip at the open on Monday with investors awaiting an interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve at its September meeting, setting the stage for rates to hit 4 per cent by the end of the year.  
  
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to increase rates by another 0.75 percentage points, taking the Fed funds rate to a range of 3 per cent to 3.25 per cent, early on Thursday (AEST).

However, odds for a mega 1 percentage point increase jumped after last week‚Äôs shock US inflation result. Bets have increased that the Federal Reserve could deliver its single biggest rate rise since 1981, although Westpac economists say such an increase would be ‚Äúunnecessary and potentially risky‚Äù.  
  
‚ÄúFollowing this week‚Äôs strong August core CPI and given recent hawkish rhetoric from FOMC members, a 75 basis point hike at the September meeting seems a done deal,‚Äù the Westpac analysts said.  
  
‚ÄúIndeed, the market is pricing some chance of a 100 basis point increase. To us, at this point in the cycle and with real term interest rates around plus 1 per cent, a 100 basis point increase is unnecessary and potentially risky.‚Äù  
  
ASX futures were down 2 points to 6737. Futures pared earlier losses as dip buyers emerged late in New York, helping to trim losses on their final session of last week.  
Markets will also be watching for an upgrade in the Fed funds dot plot projections to show a range of 4 per cent to 4.25 per cent by the end of the year. This would represent a big step up from the 3.4 per cent to 3.8 per cent range set in the June projections.

Economists anticipate US interest rates will reach 4 per cent by December and stay high throughout 2023, reflecting the tougher inflationary environment after the August core CPI growth came in hot.  
  
Commonwealth Bank senior economist Belinda Allen expects 50 basis point increases in November and December, seeing rates peak at 4 per cent to 4.25 per cent. The bank now expects a rate-cutting cycle in the fourth quarter of 2023, rather than the third quarter.

**Busy week for central banks**

The FOMC‚Äôs updated forecasts for inflation, growth and the Fed funds rate in 2023 and 2024 will be ‚Äúcritical to assessing the outlook for policy beyond September‚Äù, Westpac‚Äôs economists say.  
  
Policymakers will also gather at the Bank of England, Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank this week. The BoE is expected to raise rates 50 basis points in a shortened week for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II, although there is a risk of 75 basis points.  
  
The BoJ is expected to leave its ultra-easy monetary policy unchanged, reflecting the low inflationary environment, particularly outside of food and energy.  
  
Also on watch, global business condition PMIs are due on Friday. Australia‚Äôs business conditions are forecast to remain subdued at around August‚Äôs reading of 50.2 for the composite.  
  
Stronger than expected US CPI sent global equity markets into the red last week with growth stocks hammered. On Wall Street, all three key benchmarks closed lower on Friday in New York though off their session lows, with sentiment hit by FedEx‚Äôs shock earnings warning.  
  
**$A extreme volatility**

The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 5.5 per cent for the week, deepening its losses this year to 27 per cent. The S&amp;P 500 fell 4.8 per cent with energy pacing nine of its 11 industry sectors lower. The ASX 200 gave back 2.3 per cent, the Hang Seng fell 3.1 per cent and the Euro Stoxx 50 declined 1.95 per cent.  
  
The Australian dollar edged higher at the weekend, holding on to a US67¬¢ handle.  
  
Westpac has significantly revised its forecasts for the dollar by the year‚Äôs end to US69¬¢ from US73¬¢.  
  
Analysts say tailwinds will be outweighed by ‚Äúa much more aggressive US FOMC‚Äù than expected and China‚Äôs zero-COVID policy and its parlous property market.  
  
‚ÄúOver the course of the remainder of 2022, we expect extreme volatility in the AUD/USD around that US69¬¢ track as the supercharged US dollar is challenged and the efforts from the Chinese authorities to revitalise the Chinese economy continue apace,‚Äù Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said.  
  
‚ÄúBut the dominant headwind for a risk currency like the $A will be ongoing uncertainty in 2022 ‚Äì uncertainty about the level and timing of the peak in central bank interest rates (especially the FOMC), and uncertainty about the global inflation profile.‚Äù  
  
In a quiet week for local data, the Reserve Bank of Australia will release its latest meeting minutes on Tuesday, with speeches by two executives on Monday and Wednesday in a week shortened by the National Day of Mourning on Thursday and, for Victoria, the Friday before Grand Final Day holiday.  
  
The ASX will close on Thursday for the Queen‚Äôs public mourning holiday.  
  
RBA head of domestic markets Jonathon Kearns will speak on Interest Rates and the Property Market on Monday at the AFR Property Summit 2022 in Sydney."

A lot of financial advisors, for all their fancy talk and attempts to sound all edumahcated and shit, don't perform much better than a chicken on meth scratching at the various tickers.

It's something to keep in mind when looking at your own performance, as many large scale funds don't perform much better than ~3.5% YOY.

Prior to the current inflation frenzy, if you were doing better than ~7-8% YOY with your positions...percentage wise you were beating the fuck out of a lot of 'serious players' out there.

As such, have a think about how the 'expert' advice compares to your own performance and feel free to do whatever you like with that information.

This should not be considered financial advice and is just my own personal opinion, and I once licked paint to see what it tasted like.

devonham,iowytw4,ASX_Bets,2022-09-18 11:49:33,Fair enough. Way I see it is you're either betting on drilling results or youre betting on a mine being developed. All drilling result plays are nearology to a certain extent. LNRs pre drilling magnetic resonance mapping makes it a pretty good drilling bet in my view. I'd check those announcements out if you're interested. But yeah if you invest based on likelihood of mine development fair enough to stay with companies that are further along the development pathway. But a large proportion of the companies on the list you posted are far more marginal nearology plays than LNR.
Doomkoon4648,iowxi3s,ASX_Bets,2022-09-18 11:36:19,This wasn't my table just ported it over here so yeah some companies missing etc. My perspective is i see LNR as a nearology play atm it may not be and I may be wrong but that's my consensus and out of my play of Risk vs Reward. If it keeps going Ham for you all the better but I like to see more drill results etc and not leaning on the companies close by.
devonham,iows5vh,ASX_Bets,2022-09-18 10:43:53,"I'm not sure what you mean by not concerned about SP movement but concerned about it's economics. What is your definition of economics and why include SP movement in your original post?

Doomkoon4648,iowkiyc,ASX_Bets,2022-09-18 09:07:10,"I'll try and find sf2th post about IAC vs Clay deposits but the gist of it is from my understanding is Clay deposits need a stronger acid in order to leach out the TREO from the Clay which inturn the deposits need to be larger/higher PPM and better strip ratios than a IAC (IAC is generally 1-1 depth/thickness). 
Put all that together and Clay deposits start to fail economically.

Then there is the in-depth shit I don't understand fully yet in the seperation process."
Doomkoon4648,iowj9wv,ASX_Bets,2022-09-18 08:49:59,Yeah its a tricky word that can throw off met work results. Pretty much unless a company does a PH4 met work test right up on clay based RE keep a little distance.

So all in all if they use anything other than PH4 salt leach then it's not Ionic nature and they taking the piss with strong acids.

The recon that‚Äôs been done at Party City stores across the states show healthy customer flow and positive outlook. Around the same time that BBBY announced reducing employees by 20% and closing 150 stores, PRTY announced hiring 20,000 seasonal employees. Halloween is coming and in some parts of the USA they just removed Covid-19 restrictions over the summer and most kids are back in school. It‚Äôs expected to be the biggest Halloween since 2019 and judging from what I‚Äôm seeing it‚Äôs going to be huge. Never seen so much Halloween stuff this early in the season.


As for the meme thing I think PRTY has potential to be the GOAT of memes just because of the ticker. Easy to work PRTY into phrases like, ‚ÄúWelcome to the PRTY, Let‚Äôs PRTY, PRTY like it‚Äôs $19.99, or PRTY on, dude.‚Äù"

Thiswilldo164,ioum376,ASX_Bets,2022-09-17 22:02:45,This is not correct. You have to apply all losses to your gain before any discount is applied. Use a tax accountant for $100 - it‚Äôs also a tax deduction.

Moxanz2,iosa4t6,ASX_Bets,2022-09-17 11:36:15,So I want sure whether to do it your way. In which you apply the CGT discount to the parcel that made a profit and then subtract the losses from the parcels that made a loss OR to not apply any discounts giving me a net profit of $3247.67 and then just halving that giving me $1623.835
Sloppycism,ios97vh,ASX_Bets,2022-09-17 11:26:07,"Yeah, so hypothetically, some parcels racked up a capital loss of $1076.14 and one parcel made a capital gain of $4323.81 and that one comes with a $2161.905 capital gain discount that you may be able to apply. The net capital gain excluding discount is $3247.67, so you can apply discounts up to that amount, bringing the net capital gain after discounts down to $1085.765. Is that what you expect?"
Moxanz2,ios7p4o,ASX_Bets,2022-09-17 11:08:05,The ATO example has the person applying the discount after losses are added to the gain. But that example has the loss being carried forward from a previous year.

Unlucky_Government92,iorq0gg,ausstocks,2022-09-17 07:15:43,"I think if you are only looking to invest $100/mnth it will be best to put this into superannuation. 

On average super funds return something Like 7% per year, that's hard to beat if you are not actively investing. 

If you really want to start investing yourself you could start with an ETF  like VAS which you can continue to put your monthly investment $ into.

SuperHero has finally just allowed us to DCA (Dollar Cost Averge) our investments by setting up automatic transfers and buying of stocks each month.

You might get an average return of 5% annually on an ETF but also compounded interest over time as you buy more units and factor in dividends paid over the next 30 to 40 years.... Might be nice to have an investment that you can control as you earn more. 

Up to you but until you have a little more cash to invest I might just stick it in Super annuation and let them invest it."

baldynumbers,ioqou2o,ausstocks,2022-09-17 01:09:12,Agree - self awareness of risk and how investment markets work is essential
baldynumbers,ioqog0j,ausstocks,2022-09-17 01:06:03,"thats mostly right... 

earnings within a super fund are taxed at 15%... so technically it could be more that half tax (if your marginal rate is greater than 30%).  Contributions to superannuation post tax (not salary sacrificed) do attract a tax on payment into your fund... but this is kinda offset by the lower tax on earnings while in there.

If you earn less than 37k pa.. and you do non-concessional (post tax) contributions into super - there is also a rebate by the gov of up to 500 pa. More info: google LISTO

Superannuation when turned into a pension or lump sum (at retirement) is technically tax free

Downside of super is that it is (or should be) locked away until you retire or reach 65.

On the positive for OP... any investment you make is better than spending it on shit you eventually realise you never needed and it has the chance to grow into something bigger."

Lord_Bendtner6,ioset5i,ausstocks,2022-09-17 12:24:31,"Sounds about right. If someone buys bonds, they buy it at the price on offer or limit buy.. then the rising bond yields mean that bond value will decrease. The major majority of bond holders are governments/central banks, so follow the money they say and you'll discover that China has been dumping US treasuries all year. Plus with QT properly beginning this month there will be less dollars in the world sending yields up as well. Only a very small percentage of dollars are actually in the US. 85% of the supply is held overseas. ECB is cucked as everyone is fleeing europe causing currency devaluations and increasing inflation which put the favour out of bonds sending yields up. Japan and Europe are the largest USD holders, also the most indebted with failing debt markets. Looking at capital Flow is very worthwhile."

It's just about understanding when you need to shift your investment style depending on the economic cycle at the time.

Orisis_,iorpfei,ausstocks,2022-09-17 07:07:52,"Right now we are seeing a shift within the economy, and what that will do is test retail investors especially. 

Moving into ETFs is not a bad idea, but it depends on the ETFs that you pick. It's important to monitor your current portfolio and if you see that your holdings are sensitive to interest rate hikes in terms of increase in liabilities, bad debt etc then you should do a thorough understanding of whether selling your holdings is beneficial for the long-term. 

As the economy will slow down over the next few years due to the factor of the monetary policy being kicked in to increase interest rates, the equities market as a whole will see a slowdown as well. 

Right now you'll start to see the credit market look more attractive, and this is already happening. So researching some fixed-income securities, bonds, and money market ETFs would be something that you should consider for your portfolio. 

As you state that you are new to investing in general here are just some quick dot points I would highly suggest looking into to better your knowledge

&amp;#x200B;

* How does inflation affect my investments?
   * Interest Rate Sensitive Holdings / Sectors (Financials, Insurance, Mining, Utilities etc.)
*  Credit Market
   * Fixed Income Securities, Bonds, Money Market products etc.
* Investing Risk Profiles (*Investment Risk Profile - Bank Commonwealth* good page for understanding)
* Fundamental Macroeconomics
* Portfolio Risk Management Controls"
Pasha1997,ior7pxu,ausstocks,2022-09-17 03:49:36,"Correct me if I'm wrong please. Government holds bonds that are outside the economy. When they sell bonds they are essentially offering to take a loan from the seller with fixed rates repayment. That loan never runs out while the buyer holds the bond but since the repayment value doesn't change it gets affected by inflation. By selling bonds they remove the cash from rotation and lower the inflation. And vice versa, if government buys bonds back it releases the cash back in to the economy all at once causing inflation and drop in bond value...as a result in decrease in yield power. Is that sort of correct?"

baldynumbers,iocvko5,ausstocks,2022-09-14 05:02:14,"yep - I use it for small holdings where I intend to dollar cost average into my position... and also US stock exposure - shares are held by trust - so you don't get a chess statement and the annual tax report at EOY reports aussie stocks individually, US stock income gets summarised and ETFs get a AMIT report for each one held... TBH I don't think they report NZ dividends correctly for me (I am AUS) - normally ASX listed NZ companies pay a supplementary dividend to offset the withholding tax that foreign investors have to pay... we dont see the supplementary bit and I am not sure that results in the right reporting at tax time.

I have only sold one position on Sharesies - I didn't get any summary of that with my EOY document, so make sure you separately note your buy and sells if you exit a position.

Dividends are a bit annoying to be honest - some they pay out same day or soon after... others I have had to chase them up as to why the dividend hasn't been paid.  I direct debit deposits into my Sharesies wallet and they appear nice and quick (within minutes), but have not yet tried to actually withdraw any cash - so cannot say how quickly the process occurs.

AFAIK - their FX fees are not the cheapest, but IMO for the average person that uses the platform and the value of the individual trade, I don't think it is really something that will cost a lot more or be a matter of concern.

TLDR - its clearly not a fully automated system, so somethings must fall through the cracks sometimes.  Support team has always been very helpful when I have come across this issue (or other questions).  

Otherwise its a very usable platform and the fact there is no minimum investment means you can play baller with peanuts :P"

I can understand what you mean by selling to close in first paragraph and selling to open in second paragraph 

it might sounds stupid and stubborn but im just trying to get a full picture of how the option market works instead .

in case of selling to close am i just simply selling back to the option pool or directly to the next buyer ?  and is it always the same person at the very beginning who sell to open  bear the the risk ? 

its ironic i understand how those options strategies works such as butterfly but i just couldnt get the basic concept ."

1. Selling a call option you bought on the market. You don't incur a liability to deliver here, because it's assumed by the seller (writer) of your call option; maybe it's easier if you see this as 'closing' the call option you purchased. 
2. Selling a new call option for a premium and assuming liability to deliver the underlying asset (this is called writing a call option, but also referred to as selling a call."

isnt the writer the same as the seller ?? sorry im so confused"
Unfair-Scale,iobbzrx,ausstocks,2022-09-13 21:51:00,"Bro are you writing a call option or selling one you bought? 

First part: you can sell or exercise an ITM call option and sell the underlying, usually the former is more convenient.

Second part: If you own the call option, you don't have a buyer because you are a buyer. You would only have a buyer when you sell/write a call option, in which case you would deliver the underlying in the event of exercise.

baldynumbers,io2eob4,ausstocks,2022-09-12 01:05:03,"I personally use CMC, but have also used Netwealth, NabTrade and CBA... service is essentially the same - be smart about your cost per trade (additional services such as live data and charts are not really needed when starting out and just cause an increase in cost)

The best thing about ETFs is the diversification. Diversification can be used to manage risk... cash, fixed interest/bonds, property, infrastructure, stocks, thematic (eg. Mining/renewables/ESG)... ETFs provide exposure to all of this.

There are also ETFs that provide a mix of all of these assets in one.

You really need to consider that geographically as well - Australia is just 1.37% of world GDP... the flipside to this is that Australian companies pay franking credits (which you get to offset against your income).

If I was to start a portfolio from nothing and wanted long term returns and diversification... I would suggest a pre-made diversified fund as a core... VDHG as it is their high growth fund (I will suggest Vanguard, but there others BetaShares, iShares, VanEyk &amp;  ETFSecurities being examples... but there are many others) and then make smaller investments in other ETFs to gain more direct exposure to asset classes or themes to suit your personal profile

Main - VDGR - exposure to seven separate indexes put like 70% of funds here

Satelite - 

VBLD - infrastructure (power, water, pipes, transport, communication) 10%

IOO - global largest 100 companies by market cap 10%

QRE/DRUG/HACK/CLNE/FOOD/DZZF/VAP/DGRE .... whatever! 10%

HYL888,inyw7pd,ausstocks,2022-09-11 10:02:31,"Thanks very much to everyone who replied. All of your comments have been so helpful.
I was unaware of the risk that is involved with investing in the stock market. I knew that stocks fluctuate a lot over the years and I'm prepared for that, but ultimately I don't want to lose any of my money. I plan to dollar cost average for at least the next 15-20 years, forget about the money I put in, then sell at the right time and pocket my profits.

I would like to ask which online brokerage companies are best for Australian citizens?
I was planning on opening an account with Selfwealth, but I have recently read so many negative reviews about them.
All of the other Australian based online brokerage companies I've come across also have many negative reviews, so I'm unsure where I should open an account.

Additionally, I am unsure if I should stick to Australian ETFs such the ASX 200, or get exposure to the US market as well with a VTI or VOO?"

Would absolutely use online brokerage over a broker. Absolutely do some reading and self assessments to understand your risk profile‚Ä¶ only invest with what you can afford to lose, your stated timeframe would lead to allowing growth stocks having the best opportunity for best return. ETFs are the cheapest way to diversify, but best growth may come from direct exposure to the right asset.

AlJazeera has become interesting. Generally unbiased non-sensationalised. Broad coverage, fair number of non-bothersome ads to pay for it.

Most media sources are strong biased one way or the other, so some people find a hard right and hard left source to hear the views at the extreme ends and make up their own mind. For example anything Murdoch vs. most things Guardian. Sky News has the batshit crazy right-wing extremist stuff.

Our job as investors is to turn over rocks and try to find the hidden gems. And they always exist. Ignore anyone who tells you that the market has accurately priced every stock. That‚Äôs bullshit. Mr Market is bipolar and acts on emotion, not facts or logic. Brokers, analysts, the financial media, etc, are all motivated by a range of influences that are unrelated to cold, hard analysis - eg bonuses, reputation, peer pressure, competition, etc. SDG, btw, was in the #2 position in my buy list last week."

Some are just boring low growth companies who will likely pay a dividend but probably go backwards in price over time (eg telstra). So the key is to look at macro trends for a company as well."

Bottom line is, both of your mentioned funds are solid investments backed by a reputable fund. 

If you are 100% ethically motivated, it would be a good idea to dig deeper into the holdings (eg big banks/industrials/real estate) and feel how they sit with your objective. Furthermore, use a screening tool like trading view that lets you ""layer"" fund performances - how are they tracking against each other? Are you possibly sacrificing a higher return for your ethical compass? How does that sit with you?

In my personal opinion, I found it easier to weight my portfolio ethically rather than going all into a ""green"" fund. I do that by holding broad index ETFs and buying stocks separately that 100% align with my ethics. This way I do minimize the risks of overexposure to a certain theme of the market whilst actively associating my investments with companies a can identify with.

I am sure you will make the right decision! Good luck :)"

nytelynx,imlf8yp,ausstocks,2022-09-01 00:13:12,"I'll just throw in my 2c on this too. Finding specific details in what assets they hold is a mix of understanding the industry, the company itself and the books. Some things you just won't be able to know with more obscure companies. The more niche it is the harder to value. 

In the case of cash converters where you asked about the $175m in net receivables, investors are indeed discounting this amount significantly. It comes back to the quality of asset here, they're not quality assets at all.  These are small, easy to obtain loans usually from $1K to $50k at very high interest rates. The people being lent the money aren't exactly good with money either as they have low credit scores, difficulty getting loans with regular banks, higher rates of defaults etc.

Same principle applies in a liquidation sale, companies won't want to purchase the loan books because of the quality of loans, and if they did, it would require a big discount."
xGossipGoat,imkxmzz,ausstocks,2022-08-31 22:05:47,"Thank you for your great response! Completely agree I should have applied the lens of the actual assets that they have which in this case would be a lot of random junk. If we were looking at a more obscure company however, how would we go about finding specific detail into the assets they hold? I know the financial statements break it into the different categories.

Also going back to your first statement regarding future cash flow - I agree that investors pay for future performance but isn‚Äôt the asset value quite important to shareholders regardless of its ability to make a business profit? 

My reasoning being that in the worst case should the business go bankrupt then what the actual company is worth is assets minus liabilities. Given that a company has quality assets and also accounting for liquidation prices of say 70-80% it kind of gives you an absolute minimum that the company should be trading for given all else"
cakeofzerg,imivok7,ausstocks,2022-08-31 14:12:06,"Investors pay for future cash flows, and in the case of CCV investors are not willing to pay much. Assets don't really matter to us shareholders unless management will be able make a business profit out of them (or unless they are going to sell them off and give us a special dividend).


In the case of CCV quality of assets are also a consideration. In accounting rules you are allowed to put down the tangible value of assets as what you paid for them but if you ever go into one of the stores you can see they have a whole stack of worthless junk which will never sell (that's on balance sheet at full price). Eventually it will get written off whenever it is convenient for the company to reduce tax.


When you do screens on metrics like price to book what always happens is that the cheapest stocks are the absolute dogs you probably should touch (they are cheap for a reason). You gotta look further down the list to find actual value."

Money will cover anticipated costs to get Phase 1 pilot plant up and running, including costs of permitting (budgeted $12m just for that‚Ä¶ ouch!).

This is turning out to be a major lithium find in the US‚Ä¶  And don‚Äôt forget the bromine they will also be direct-extracting‚Ä¶ big zinc/bromine batteries for ESS.‚Ä¶ Probably one of the reasons why ASN gave Lilac Solutions the boot and went with SunResin‚Ä¶ Lilac is a one trick pony, currently extracting only lithium.  
ASN is shaping up to be a rare double play. When the final assay results come in for the Phase 2 portion of the project and the JORC is revised, share price should go up significantly.

They have $5.7M in cash and a $15M loan @5%. Expenses are $3M a quarter so they have 2 years at that rate to secure funding. I think 2 years is pretty good for an exploration company and the US government wants Lithium so I personally give it a low risk of receivership and not getting funding. Their timeline says they aim to secure funding this year so we will know soon and that will derisk it and probably increase the SP again.

_cannotdecide,imh9gjo,ausstocks,2022-08-31 03:44:50,"Yeah i‚Äôm still learning to but one of the first things i learned is it‚Äôs not always as simple as buying at a low and selling at a high. Especially with those low cap miners a lot of the time they have some good sounding news and rocket up and then everyone forgets them and they crash. I prefer to look for those small caps that have something to show, whether it‚Äôs actual results for resources they‚Äôve found or some take off agreements or anything that shows they actually have found something, that way risk is already reduced as they‚Äôve got something to go off. Now that doesn‚Äôt just mean any company that has results bc the next issue would be good/bad results and they don‚Äôt always mean anything if it‚Äôs still a shit company. But hopefully you get where i‚Äôm coming from. 

Also one issue with those micro caps as in i‚Äôm talking &lt;1c is often you‚Äôll see them bounce between maybe 0.5c and 1c for example and you go cool i‚Äôll just buy at 0.5c and double my money when it goes to 1c. The issue is these companies often have very very little trades occurring bc they are complete rubbish and probably just about out of money. So if you buy at the 0.5c there may not actually be any buyers at 1c and sometimes that can drag for months and months and months and is super risky. Just another thing to think about with them."

MachinaDoctrina,imcqp47,ausstocks,2022-08-30 05:46:56,"From a research perspective the market is a chaotic system, yes it's deterministic but there are too many exogenous variables to be modelled deterministically, a simpler chaotic system is the weather. 

Don't get me wrong chaotic systems can be modelled the problem is most of the assumptions are typically based on the ""rational market"" model etc. These models don't explain short term volatility very well. There is some interesting research into gauging sentiment (though things like NLP) but there is not a single source of information for stocks it's very hard to gather that information in time.

The main problem is your dealing with memetic theory how an idea mutates and propagates though the public, which is then interpreted by each individual based on a prior (almost always not a Bayesian prior unfortunately, see ""thinking fast and slow"") that determines how they see the future value of the company compared to their fundamentals which they then determine their internal acceptable risk which values the stock. You can see how the meme (the idea) can be shaped and mutated, much like a game of Chinese whispers, and this is shaped by individual and collective beliefs which are very hard to model."

I‚Äôm not a professional trader but that‚Äôs as far as my understanding goes.

I do have experience trying to sell a small cap stock at market value only to find a stale mate as you called it, trying to secure a buyer for my asking price.

Eventually I had to lower my sell order for break even just to complete the trade."
Pasha1997,im8mk56,ausstocks,2022-08-29 10:27:16,I think I see what you are saying. Essentially no one would want to purchase the stock during the peak time. And no one wants to sell at lowest price after everyone sold high and price went back down. So market cap can essentially be described as a stale mate between the traders that breaks when someone makes a move based on external factors or company announcements. Does that sound correct?
Unlucky_Government92,im8m556,ausstocks,2022-08-29 10:21:51,"If I'm thinking I understand the question look at this trap....

MRD (Mount Ridley mines)
Look at the charts, Price bounces from 0.05 to 0.06 regularly and looks like an opportunity to make quick money HOWEVER... 

Based in charts alone you may think that you could sell @0.06 as the market does reach these targets however you need a buyer to fulfil the order. And the wait for the market to hit 0.05 and repeat the process... Easy money.

You need to check the market depth to see if there are buyers and what they are willing to pay.

If there is no one wanting to buy at the example price of @0.06 you are stuck with the shares and you will be waiting A LONG TIME for anyone to buy them."
IncurableThinker,im8lvlg,ausstocks,2022-08-29 10:18:22,"Ultimately the share price is a reflection of market cap. In your example, you‚Äôre acting as a market maker by creating liquidity, and while you may create small price movements in the stock, the challenge would be fulfilling a sell order for the new price that you‚Äôve artificially created.

Your strategy could work if you trade a large percentage of the float, thereby manipulating the stock price and influencing other retail investors to buy in, until you pull the rug and walk away with a huge profit."
Pasha1997,im8l3c3,ausstocks,2022-08-29 10:07:54,That's a good point. I suppose based on previous trends if the company has an extended record?

-Classify the stock: income ie dividend, growth ie going up or speculator.

- A lot of clickbait articles and webpages out there. Check some details yourself, simple stuff like do they make money or will they.

- learn risk and what you want to risk.

You'd also want to try and find out if you'd be paying anything different in home &amp; contents insurance for the duration or completion of the project IMO. 

I looked at a place a couple of years ago that had been compulsorily acquired via the Vic gov for the (now defunct) east west project. I didn't buy because of my concerns a change in state gov could cause those plans to resurface and compulsory acquisition to occur again. 

My understanding is unless there are major changes to the project all the comp acq has been completed. However, in Victoria it's near impossible to fight a compulsory acquisition, though they do seem to pay better than market value pretty consistently.

lakwatsa,iovkibv,AusProperty,2022-09-18 02:32:09,"Life is more than just about capital appreciation, because otherwise we'd all be living as cheaply as possible and refusing to buy anything other than the bare minimum required to stay alive, lol.

&amp;nbsp;

I bought a Melbourne CBD apartment to live in fully knowing that it would have been financially more sensible to invest in house and land somewhere regional or interstate given my budget. I did a tonne of research to make sure my apartment was of liveable quality(i.e. no flammable cladding, no crazy fighting in the body corporate meeting minutes, healthy sinking fund, no major defects, no weird mouldy smells during inspection, common areas are clean and well-maintained). The building I'm in is older than the one you're in and was made before construction standards starting getting dodgy. I'm in a north-east facing place that gets lots of sunlight and is well insulated. Good quality apartments are actually quite hard to find because there is a looooot of crap out there. I've been renting for years and it's like a kick in the gut every time a landlord kicks you out because they want to sell or because they want to move in themselves, then you're forced to join long, miserable queues every Saturday to inspect new places to live that don't look anything like the pictures on the ad.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, the key to this decision is really knowing yourself. I knew I would not regret buying this place because I have already experienced what it's like to live in many other types of places(rural areas, suburbs, inner-suburbs, as well as had multiple stints living and working overseas and other states). Every place has its pros and cons, so you have to really understand yourself as a person on what will suit you the best. I am also in my 40s now, and I have taken the time to explore in my 20s and 30s, so I don't really have a lot of regrets or FOMOs anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

If you are uncertain if you even want to live in Australia in 5 years time, then you should think more carefully before you make this purchase as you will probably make a loss, unless you're happy to keep it forever and rent it out and deal with maintenance expenses and taxes as a non-resident.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, I don't know what type of dog you want, but if it's a large one that needs a large yard, then obviously don't buy an apartment. Some of my neighbours have small or medium-sized dogs that look healthy and happy. I see them take them out for walks every morning or every night when I pass by them in the lifts. I don't hear the dogs barking at all due to the great sound insulation in our building. Or perhaps they are responsible owners who have trained their dogs well and the dogs are not distressed, hence no barking or howling. I have lived in suburbs before where there were some very miserable dogs living a terrible existence in backyards and were constantly baying for attention or digging up shit because their owners didn't give them enough exercise.

&amp;nbsp;

The other key to this is how much you currently have in cash and other assets. Before I bought my place, I had enough in cash for a 20% deposit and didn't need to liquidate my stock portfolio. I also still had enough leftover to pay any other purchase costs, moving costs, and still had 6+ months in an emergency fund. I also factored in what it will cost me monthly in mortgage(including forecasting interest rates rising to 10%), rates, body corporate fees and water bills, and I would still be left with more than enough to enjoy a city lifestyle and continue to save and invest for retirement. I got a loan smaller than what the banks approved me for. So knowing that I had budgeted to make a lifestyle choice and not a financial investment helped mitigate any money anxieties.
It's similar to how other people make other big choices that may not be the most financially optimal ones, e.g. quitting high-paying jobs to take a long sabbatical to travel the world, buying a luxury car instead of cheaper one that would be just as reliable getting them from A to B, moving out of their parents' home where they could have lived rent-free, etc. etc.
Even buying a dog is not a financially optimal decision, I mean have you seen what vet bills can be like?? ;)
But people still do these things because we are human, not just spreadsheets with legs.
Good luck with whatever decision you decide to make!"

I did love living there and wouldn't have moved if it weren't for that. But a few regrets/things I wish I knew earlier:
- Our body corporate fees increased from $6k/year to $10.5k/year over the 3 years we lived there due to rising insurance premiums.
- I was happy to commit to an apartment with low capital growth thinking it would be a long term commitment. However, now that we have sold and are upgrading back to a house, the growth that houses have experienced over the last couple of years has really hit us hard and we now have a big extra expense to buy into that market.

I get this isn't the stock market but it's pretty much the same principle.

On a 1 million dollar home this week 7k is a 0.07% decrease in value which is practically nothing plus it's not like every single house in Aus lost 7k some houses here are worth close to 3-4mil. Where did this 7k figure come from? It feels like someone just pulled it up their ass...


Did a 3 million dollar house lose 7k 

Or a 1 million 

Or a 800k house? 


It's just a shitty week. It might a shitty year. Last year property prices grew by a insane amount. Heck it might be a shitty decade. I doubt that with Inflation going the way it is but point is... Markets will do what they always have they will go up and down. There are people which will hype it one way or the other. 

It's a user based system. If you don't want your precious prices to fall stop being scared and spreading fear. Just weather the storm from the people who don't know how control theirs. 

And also, yeah ... House prices will fall interest rates are going up. Did we really think they would stabilise or continue to grow during this time? It's not really that shocking that during a time of higher interest rates, growing cost of living pressures.

It is very normal for a Bank to require a GST clause like that in the contract, as the property being GST exempt can depend on both its use prior to sale, and it‚Äôs use after the sale. They can‚Äôt control how you use the property after settlement, so they shift the GST liability to you."

Or maybe the mortgagee who is selling the property (maybe it‚Äôs a liquidator on behalf of the bank) thinks it should be a taxable supply for GST.

Z---,iopjotk,AusProperty,2022-09-16 20:03:04,"This is odd.  Residential property is input taxed:

&gt;Input-taxed sales are sales of goods and services that don't include GST in the price. You can't claim GST credits for the GST included in the price of your 'inputs'.

The most common input-taxed sales are financial supplies (such as lending money or the provision of credit for a fee) and selling or renting out residential premises.

https://www.ato.gov.au/business/gst/when-to-charge-gst-(and-when-not-to)/input-taxed-sales/

Only new property attracts GST. This property is not new, and being MIP does not change that. 

The issue with your conveyancer is possibly semantic, you cannot say this second hand property sale price includes GST as that means you can claim an input tax credit of 1/11 of the contract price.  That is not what you expect to do, so the vendor is likely correct in saying no to your conveyancers request.  Let them sort it out.

Your concern about having to pay $685k plus 10% GST is not what is being argued between the conveyancers here, I would not be concerned about that.  Your conveyancer should not be trying to say the price includes GST, the sale is input taxed,  

The only wrinkle I can imagine is if this house is commercially zoned , is vacant and has been used as a home business like a Drs surgery or or something like that?  Double check this residential house is not in a commercial zone with previous commercial use.  If that is yes then GST is in play, but from your explanation it seems unlikely."

We've had a couple of years with no real immigration and are about to increase the permanent resident intake. All those people need somewhere to live, to work, to buy things etc.

In the meantime, we have a general housing shortage. People brought forward their purchasing of homes because they had more money and needed more space. In some markets, housing was also constrained due to flooding. 

So when more people immigrate to Australia, they are going to need somewhere to live, eat and work.

With respect to housing, some will live six or seven guys in a 2 bdr unit for a while (saw that first hand myself) but eventually will look to getting their own place. As that happens, the demand on housing will increase- people can move to Australia in a shorter period of time than housing stock can be built.

During the pandemic, whilst yes a lot of people left, a lot of people were still working and didn't have anything to spend their money one. Couple that with record low interest rates and the RBA stating they won't rise for many years, plus the ability to cash out on Super - meant that a lot of people jumped on the bandwagon of buying.

I agree, you've been priced out of ""sleeper suburbs"" like the ones you mention, by which I mean suburbs that were within the inner 5 or 10km ring of Adelaide but with lower price per sqm than the neighbouring suburb. The rises of the last two years have been a thing to behold!

Adelaide sprawls so much these days that the outer suburbs you can afford are going to be quite a commute. It has such an impact on quality of life, it really does. So I can totally see why you might compromise and go with a strata-titled homette if you could make it work."

At the cheap end, interstaters buy Adelaide properties for the rental yield. And at the expensive end, they massively increase competition for the $2+ million homes in Adelaide which used to be uncommon and are now frighteningly common. Sydney and Melbourne money can outcompete even the filthiest rich plastic surgeon in Adelaide. With interest rate hikes, I don't see how the Adelaide market wouldn't at least *soften,* but whether we actually get significant price drops remains to be seen. It's devastating for locals.

I actually plugged 15km into one of those radius map things! The Adel suburbs in that 15km ring, fixer uppers don't go for &lt;$600k, except for a small section just north of Grand Junction rd up to about Parafield, where I think you OP will need to look if they're wanting to get the closest they can to the city for that money and aren't willing to compromise on it being a detached house. The rest of that 15km ring, $600k doesn't get you a detached home no matter how bad the condition!


If they're willing to go unit or townhouse or maisonette, they have lots of options. Whether they can have a pet in a strata title groups is a big question!"
gp_in_oz,ioi6z9a,AusProperty,2022-09-15 08:05:33,"Few questions for you from a fellow Adelaidean:


(1) If you want inner ring and low commute, are you willing to look at pet-allowing strata-title groups that are detached homettes with just a courtyard garden? Or is the dog a big dog?! What about places where there *is* a garden but it's all in the front, like this [Greenacres one](https://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-sa-greenacres-140375591) where it's the front of a battle axe lot and the garden is all frontyard, only a small area out the back?


and


(2) Are you planning a family and does school zone come into the decision? Is there a side of the city that you *like*? And is there a side of the city that would be most convenient for family, work, etc?"

Lopsided-Earth,ioi5v77,AusProperty,2022-09-15 07:49:57,I think you should start looking at Aberfoyle Park or Happy Valley/O'Halloran Hill for that price range.

what they want is always just a bit more than what they can afford"
gp_in_oz,ioi0way,AusProperty,2022-09-15 06:42:29,"&gt;Our requirements are simple: - within 15 km of CBD, ideally decent public transport to city (30mins each way on bus or train) - in a low enough crime / medium socioeconomic area


I know Adelaide has a reputation for being cheap on r/ausfinance in particular. But I always say it's *cheaper* but not cheap!


You cannot get what you want for $600k or less within 30 mins of the city. That budget will get you a strata-titled attached dwelling within 30 minutes of the city. Or a detached house north of Grand Junction Rd and south of Reynella. Adelaide's median house price is $675k currently, so trying to find a detached house with a garden within 30 mins commute of the CBD for less than the city's median is unrealistic.


Here is a google map of Adelaide's median house prices in 2021 by u/data_pusher. Because [Adelaide house prices have gone up 20-40% since then](https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/sep/15/yes-australian-house-prices-are-dropping-but-from-staggering-heights), I'd look at the blue zones on that map and not the green.


The price rises in Adelaide (and nationwide) are a very bitter pill to swallow if you're in the market for a home. It really really sucks. Especially having it run away from you in the space of 1 to 2 years.


Personally, I rent currently while I decide what to do. I hate being a renter! I would like to buy my ""forever home."" But I know myself well enough now that I would rather rent than ever do strata-title or shared walls ever again! I have broadened my search to suburbs I have never set foot in before and/or was previously too snobby to consider. Sometimes I've been priced out of suburbs I'm contemplating within the space of a few weeks! But I do think the tide is turning a little bit in Adelaide. Some vendors are having to drop their prices. Auctions are not as feverish. No-one knows whether what you want will come back down into your price range. Only you and your partner can know what compromise you'll make, location vs dwelling type.


I agree with stress-testing your loan serviceability to 7 and 8%, agree with you there.


All the best from a fellow house hunter in Adelaide :)"

e.g in the first 6 months of my ppor purchase I got a new bedroom ac, replaced the hot water system, re-pointed the roof tiles, got solar installed this was about 13k.

Every auction is still packed, every best offer by is going way above the max price range after only one open. So far I‚Äôve seen no change in buyer behaviour but we have had an incredibly low demand through winter. Based on this I strongly believe that waiting will not result in any noticeable price drop / increase in quality of home for the same price.

I got myself onto a mental healthcare plan and started seeing a psychologist once a week. With direction from the doctor I started eating better and getting back into the gym and over a period of about 3 months I got better.

Anxiety has always been something I deal with and it likes to pop up from time to time but after getting the tools I need from my sessions I have learned to work with my episodes. Of course some times I have it well under control while other I turn into a mess but I now have a much better understanding of what's causing it and how to manage it.

In the meantime, I feel like the main issue you're facing is that you're not giving enough back to your mother given how much she is supporting you.

I don‚Äôt think it makes property better than shares per se, but it‚Äôs a benefit often overlooked in comparisons. And it does require cash flow to comfortably service, which with anaemic yields on rental properties in Australian capital cities means a high earning job to manage.

Sweat Equity is another great benefit of property investing, and definitely goes against the grain of a purely passive approach. I don‚Äôt find managing properties onerous (of course, a good property manager helps here), but if 1 hour a month and a few days of maintenance / improvements every few years isn‚Äôt worth it - then you‚Äôll get weaker returns on your investment and may be better sticking to ETFs.

Lastly, you have to choose good properties. There‚Äôs no real diversification in direct real estate investing - if you‚Äôre buying cheaper properties (to reduce the debt load) then you‚Äôre less likely to get the good capital growth you need to make the debt work. Again, that‚Äôs way more effort than buying ETFs."

""5% growth pa on $2.5M is better than 7% growth on $1M, so the idea goes."" - Nominal return

""Even if you are positively geared $1K - $1.5K a week, you will always be beholden to the banks and at the whims and fluctuations of interest rates ($2M+ in debt).""

\- You have an inherent bias here w.r.t property. You are assuming that you will be able to find 5 good investments in property and then you are comparing that with index tracking funds. If you put similar effort in finding good companies to invest, your returns will be much much higher.

Yes, leverage is a huge advantage here and that is much easier in property than shares but it is a double edge sword and it completely depends on your situation. Share offer much liquidity especially in a down market. 

Snp500 nominal returns are 11% approx- that will turn your $1M to $22.9M in 30 yr period

Real estate nominal returns are 7% approx- that will turn you $1M to $19M in 30 yr period

That 11% doesnt include dividends and to be fair to real-estate, I haven't included the +ve yields that you assume. You can calculate these based on the properties that you find and come up with a best option for yourself."
arcadefiery,ip0112a,AusFinance,2022-09-19 00:15:58,"Shares have better growth historically and don't rely on increasing rental yield (which becomes hard at some point: you can only ask your serfs to crowd themselves into share houses to a certain extent before they get tired of it). So as you say, the advantages of property are things **other than** capital growth (other than in boom times): leverage, and negative gearing and income tax mitigation through depreciation. (You can negatively gear shares too but the interest rates are higher and there's no depreciation.)

For me I think a hybrid strategy works best.

However I don't like the intangibility of shares so my strategy so far has been to buy modest properties at about 4-6x income, pay them off in a short span each (relying on my own income to keep increasing), take advantage of NG and depreciation, and then in hopefully about 10 years I'll retire off the rent."

Supersnazz,ip06cyv,AusFinance,2022-09-19 00:55:28,"&gt;$2.58M house

Depending on size and area, it may simply be a cheap house that's branded as luxury.

If they are trying to sell it for 2.58 million, it probably cost 2 million and they are trying to make 500k on it.

If it's in a decentish area, the land will be 1.5 million of this. Adjust as necessary based on the real location.

That leaves 500k for the build. If it's a large house, which it probably is, then it simply isn't going to have enough in the budget for anything decent.

Because we are used to cheap builds, it is shocking when we see the price of genuinely good constructions and finish.

I recently built a 46 square house with Porter Davis. It was about 420k for the build. 4 bed - 4 living - 5 bath. I'm happy with it and it's built relatively well, but it's a volume built house, and that's obvious.

If it were a custom luxury build with good finishes, genuine timber, etc it would cost at least 2 million to build. On a 1.5 million block of land plus 500k profit, that would be a selling price of 4 million, and it wouldn't be anything *that* special."

In this specific case, a $2.58M new house doesn't say much about the build cost. Once you factor in land cost and profit margin, the build cost is like around the $1M mark which doesn't go far in today's market.

Here's what you need to know:

\*Request release: TAKE NOTE OF THE WITHOLDING TAX AND DEDUCT IT FROM THE AMOUNT.

\*Make offer on property (for us, at auction)

\*If successful, make sure you have the deposit in cash to send straight away (for us, 10%)

\*Make sure you have 6 weeks for settlement. We had 4, I don't recommend this.

\*Notify the ATO you've signed a contract (entirely online, done in minutes).

\*The ATO doesn't give a shit what you do with the funds. It literally just want to see that you've bought a house during the same FY as the amount was released. You could buy a car with it instead for all they care.

\*Worried about a cashflow issue? Ask your bank to set up the loans so you can instantly pay off the FHSS amount if it comes in after settlement

Hope this helps!"

Unlucky_Government92,iorq0gg,ausstocks,2022-09-17 07:15:43,"I think if you are only looking to invest $100/mnth it will be best to put this into superannuation. 

On average super funds return something Like 7% per year, that's hard to beat if you are not actively investing. 

If you really want to start investing yourself you could start with an ETF  like VAS which you can continue to put your monthly investment $ into.

SuperHero has finally just allowed us to DCA (Dollar Cost Averge) our investments by setting up automatic transfers and buying of stocks each month.

You might get an average return of 5% annually on an ETF but also compounded interest over time as you buy more units and factor in dividends paid over the next 30 to 40 years.... Might be nice to have an investment that you can control as you earn more. 

Up to you but until you have a little more cash to invest I might just stick it in Super annuation and let them invest it."

baldynumbers,ioqog0j,ausstocks,2022-09-17 01:06:03,"thats mostly right... 

earnings within a super fund are taxed at 15%... so technically it could be more that half tax (if your marginal rate is greater than 30%).  Contributions to superannuation post tax (not salary sacrificed) do attract a tax on payment into your fund... but this is kinda offset by the lower tax on earnings while in there.

If you earn less than 37k pa.. and you do non-concessional (post tax) contributions into super - there is also a rebate by the gov of up to 500 pa. More info: google LISTO

Superannuation when turned into a pension or lump sum (at retirement) is technically tax free

Downside of super is that it is (or should be) locked away until you retire or reach 65.

If someone buys bonds, they buy it at the price on offer or limit buy.. then the rising bond yields mean that bond value will decrease. The major majority of bond holders are governments/central banks, so follow the money they say and you'll discover that China has been dumping US treasuries all year. Plus with QT properly beginning this month there will be less dollars in the world sending yields up as well. Only a very small percentage of dollars are actually in the US. 85% of the supply is held overseas. ECB is cucked as everyone is fleeing europe causing currency devaluations and increasing inflation which put the favour out of bonds sending yields up. Japan and Europe are the largest USD holders, also the most indebted with failing debt markets. Looking at capital Flow is very worthwhile."

Orisis_,iorpfei,ausstocks,2022-09-17 07:07:52,"Right now we are seeing a shift within the economy, and what that will do is test retail investors especially. 

Moving into ETFs is not a bad idea, but it depends on the ETFs that you pick. It's important to monitor your current portfolio and if you see that your holdings are sensitive to interest rate hikes in terms of increase in liabilities, bad debt etc then you should do a thorough understanding of whether selling your holdings is beneficial for the long-term. 

As the economy will slow down over the next few years due to the factor of the monetary policy being kicked in to increase interest rates, the equities market as a whole will see a slowdown as well. 

Right now you'll start to see the credit market look more attractive, and this is already happening. So researching some fixed-income securities, bonds, and money market ETFs would be something that you should consider for your portfolio. 

As you state that you are new to investing in general here are just some quick dot points I would highly suggest looking into to better your knowledge

That loan never runs out while the buyer holds the bond but since the repayment value doesn't change it gets affected by inflation. By selling bonds they remove the cash from rotation and lower the inflation. And vice versa, if government buys bonds back it releases the cash back in to the economy all at once causing inflation and drop in bond value...as a result in decrease in yield power. Is that sort of correct?"

baldynumbers,iocvko5,ausstocks,2022-09-14 05:02:14,"yep - I use it for small holdings where I intend to dollar cost average into my position... and also US stock exposure - shares are held by trust - so you don't get a chess statement and the annual tax report at EOY reports aussie stocks individually, US stock income gets summarised and ETFs get a AMIT report for each one held... TBH I don't think they report NZ dividends correctly for me (I am AUS) - normally ASX listed NZ companies pay a supplementary dividend to offset the withholding tax that foreign investors have to pay... we dont see the supplementary bit and I am not sure that results in the right reporting at tax time.

I have only sold one position on Sharesies - I didn't get any summary of that with my EOY document, so make sure you separately note your buy and sells if you exit a position.

Dividends are a bit annoying to be honest - some they pay out same day or soon after... others I have had to chase them up as to why the dividend hasn't been paid.  I direct debit deposits into my Sharesies wallet and they appear nice and quick (within minutes), but have not yet tried to actually withdraw any cash - so cannot say how quickly the process occurs.

AFAIK - their FX fees are not the cheapest, but IMO for the average person that uses the platform and the value of the individual trade, I don't think it is really something that will cost a lot more or be a matter of concern.

TLDR - its clearly not a fully automated system, so somethings must fall through the cracks sometimes.  Support team has always been very helpful when I have come across this issue (or other questions).  

Otherwise its a very usable platform and the fact there is no minimum investment means you can play baller with peanuts :P"

I can understand what you mean by selling to close in first paragraph and selling to open in second paragraph 

it might sounds stupid and stubborn but im just trying to get a full picture of how the option market works instead .

in case of selling to close am i just simply selling back to the option pool or directly to the next buyer ?  and is it always the same person at the very beginning who sell to open  bear the the risk ? 

its ironic i understand how those options strategies works such as butterfly but i just couldnt get the basic concept ."

1. Selling a call option you bought on the market. You don't incur a liability to deliver here, because it's assumed by the seller (writer) of your call option; maybe it's easier if you see this as 'closing' the call option you purchased. 
2. Selling a new call option for a premium and assuming liability to deliver the underlying asset (this is called writing a call option, but also referred to as selling a call."

First part: you can sell or exercise an ITM call option and sell the underlying, usually the former is more convenient.

Second part: If you own the call option, you don't have a buyer because you are a buyer. You would only have a buyer when you sell/write a call option, in which case you would deliver the underlying in the event of exercise.

HYL888,xaj9es,ausstocks,2022-09-10 07:42:57,"Just starting out, seeking advice"
baldynumbers,io2eob4,ausstocks,2022-09-12 01:05:03,"I personally use CMC, but have also used Netwealth, NabTrade and CBA... service is essentially the same - be smart about your cost per trade (additional services such as live data and charts are not really needed when starting out and just cause an increase in cost)

The best thing about ETFs is the diversification. Diversification can be used to manage risk... cash, fixed interest/bonds, property, infrastructure, stocks, thematic (eg. Mining/renewables/ESG)... ETFs provide exposure to all of this.

There are also ETFs that provide a mix of all of these assets in one.

You really need to consider that geographically as well - Australia is just 1.37% of world GDP... the flipside to this is that Australian companies pay franking credits (which you get to offset against your income).

If I was to start a portfolio from nothing and wanted long term returns and diversification... I would suggest a pre-made diversified fund as a core... VDHG as it is their high growth fund (I will suggest Vanguard, but there others BetaShares, iShares, VanEyk &amp;  ETFSecurities being examples... but there are many others) and then make smaller investments in other ETFs to gain more direct exposure to asset classes or themes to suit your personal profile

Main - VDGR - exposure to seven separate indexes put like 70% of funds here

[https://www.vanguard.com.au/personal/invest-with-us/etf?portId=8221&amp;tab=holdings](https://www.vanguard.com.au/personal/invest-with-us/etf?portId=8221&amp;tab=holdings)

Satelite - 

VBLD - infrastructure (power, water, pipes, transport, communication) 10%

IOO - global largest 100 companies by market cap 10%

QRE/DRUG/HACK/CLNE/FOOD/DZZF/VAP/DGRE .... whatever! 10%

BIGGEST point! This is not financial advice, DYOR, know your risk, if looking to invest directly in a company, research its SWOT... know what you have bought and why you bought it"
Yahoo_Wabbit,io28is6,ausstocks,2022-09-12 00:17:45,Not sure why I was downvoted but exactly what happened to me. I put a bit of money into a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù investment with small returns. They made some really bad decisions and I basically lost all my money. Taught me nothing is safe and it‚Äôs the best way to learn
HYL888,inyw7pd,ausstocks,2022-09-11 10:02:31,"Thanks very much to everyone who replied. All of your comments have been so helpful.
I was unaware of the risk that is involved with investing in the stock market. I knew that stocks fluctuate a lot over the years and I'm prepared for that, but ultimately I don't want to lose any of my money. I plan to dollar cost average for at least the next 15-20 years, forget about the money I put in, then sell at the right time and pocket my profits.

I would like to ask which online brokerage companies are best for Australian citizens?
I was planning on opening an account with Selfwealth, but I have recently read so many negative reviews about them.
All of the other Australian based online brokerage companies I've come across also have many negative reviews, so I'm unsure where I should open an account.

Additionally, I am unsure if I should stick to Australian ETFs such the ASX 200, or get exposure to the US market as well with a VTI or VOO?"
Various-Truck-5115,inxyuh5,ausstocks,2022-09-11 03:32:00,"As what others have mentioned. Read all the info on Passive Investing Australia. I use cmc markets buying one lot of etf once a week. The main thing you'll learn is the share market is gambling, the only way to beat it is to hold long term and keep putting money in and reinvesting your returns."
baldynumbers,inxx221,ausstocks,2022-09-11 03:16:34,"Agree with almost everything that has already been said‚Ä¶ you could also look at investing in index or thematic themes via Vanguard directly.  This would allow you to buy more regularly at parcels less than 500 after the initial investment - better way to dollar cost average your purchases in the current market IMO‚Ä¶ 

Would absolutely use online brokerage over a broker. Absolutely do some reading and self assessments to understand your risk profile‚Ä¶ only invest with what you can afford to lose, your stated timeframe would lead to allowing growth stocks having the best opportunity for best return. ETFs are the cheapest way to diversify, but best growth may come from direct exposure to the right asset.

Good luck, keep asking questions and learning"
ship_wright,inxp2mt,ausstocks,2022-09-11 02:10:12,"This‚òùÔ∏è
Best lesson for me was losing a fair whack on STO. Taught me nothing is safe in the market. Also made me mad that my investment rationale didn‚Äôt align with what I actually believed. Made me start to think more about what sectors, commodities, tech etc might prosper based on societal trends. Through that I‚Äôve then slowly developed some tools to assess individual stonks, and make entry and exit decisions and adjustments based on value risk/reward. Definitely risky still, but way more fun. I‚Äôm convinced the market is rigged, I‚Äôve stopped trying to fight it, and have learned to be patient. Haven‚Äôt owned a divvy stock for 4 years, in smsf or trading account. Definitely got lucky a couple of times, but I‚Äôd be well over 10x up on where I‚Äôd be if there id be if I‚Äôd compounded my money in an etf over the last 5 or 6 years. Not for everyone, it‚Äôs stressful at times, and need to start really small."
Yahoo_Wabbit,inxb91o,ausstocks,2022-09-11 00:20:29,"Personally I just went for it. Figured out what people would need and bought in. After following the market for 6 years its clear only the rich control the market. I‚Äôve had shares come out and announce big things, only for a huge share holder to offload and the shares crash. 

Don‚Äôt spend what you‚Äôre not prepared to lose, it‚Äôs basically acceptable gambling."

AlJazeera has become interesting. Generally unbiased non-sensationalised. Broad coverage, fair number of non-bothersome ads to pay for it.

Most media sources are strong biased one way or the other, so some people find a hard right and hard left source to hear the views at the extreme ends and make up their own mind. For example anything Murdoch vs. most things Guardian. Sky News has the batshit crazy right-wing extremist stuff.

Our job as investors is to turn over rocks and try to find the hidden gems. And they always exist. Ignore anyone who tells you that the market has accurately priced every stock. That‚Äôs bullshit. Mr Market is bipolar and acts on emotion, not facts or logic.

Some are just boring low growth companies who will likely pay a dividend but probably go backwards in price over time (eg telstra). So the key is to look at macro trends for a company as well."

Bottom line is, both of your mentioned funds are solid investments backed by a reputable fund. 

If you are 100% ethically motivated, it would be a good idea to dig deeper into the holdings (eg big banks/industrials/real estate) and feel how they sit with your objective. Furthermore, use a screening tool like trading view that lets you ""layer"" fund performances - how are they tracking against each other? Are you possibly sacrificing a higher return for your ethical compass? How does that sit with you?

In my personal opinion, I found it easier to weight my portfolio ethically rather than going all into a ""green"" fund. I do that by holding broad index ETFs and buying stocks separately that 100% align with my ethics. This way I do minimize the risks of overexposure to a certain theme of the market whilst actively associating my investments with companies a can identify with.

nytelynx,imlf8yp,ausstocks,2022-09-01 00:13:12,"I'll just throw in my 2c on this too. Finding specific details in what assets they hold is a mix of understanding the industry, the company itself and the books. Some things you just won't be able to know with more obscure companies. The more niche it is the harder to value. 

In the case of cash converters where you asked about the $175m in net receivables, investors are indeed discounting this amount significantly. It comes back to the quality of asset here, they're not quality assets at all.  These are small, easy to obtain loans usually from $1K to $50k at very high interest rates. The people being lent the money aren't exactly good with money either as they have low credit scores, difficulty getting loans with regular banks, higher rates of defaults etc.

Same principle applies in a liquidation sale, companies won't want to purchase the loan books because of the quality of loans, and if they did, it would require a big discount."
xGossipGoat,imkxmzz,ausstocks,2022-08-31 22:05:47,"Thank you for your great response! Completely agree I should have applied the lens of the actual assets that they have which in this case would be a lot of random junk. If we were looking at a more obscure company however, how would we go about finding specific detail into the assets they hold? I know the financial statements break it into the different categories.

Also going back to your first statement regarding future cash flow - I agree that investors pay for future performance but isn‚Äôt the asset value quite important to shareholders regardless of its ability to make a business profit? 

My reasoning being that in the worst case should the business go bankrupt then what the actual company is worth is assets minus liabilities. Given that a company has quality assets and also accounting for liquidation prices of say 70-80% it kind of gives you an absolute minimum that the company should be trading for given all else"
cakeofzerg,imivok7,ausstocks,2022-08-31 14:12:06,"Investors pay for future cash flows, and in the case of CCV investors are not willing to pay much. Assets don't really matter to us shareholders unless management will be able make a business profit out of them (or unless they are going to sell them off and give us a special dividend).


In the case of CCV quality of assets are also a consideration. In accounting rules you are allowed to put down the tangible value of assets as what you paid for them but if you ever go into one of the stores you can see they have a whole stack of worthless junk which will never sell (that's on balance sheet at full price). Eventually it will get written off whenever it is convenient for the company to reduce tax.


When you do screens on metrics like price to book what always happens is that the cheapest stocks are the absolute dogs you probably should touch (they are cheap for a reason). You gotta look further down the list to find actual value."

Fast_Tracking,iooumfk,ausstocks,2022-09-16 17:18:48,"There was so much interest in the latest share placement, ASN released more shares than anticipated.‚Ä¶ This coming Monday they will receive $50m for shares placed ‚Äúto institutions and sophisticated investors‚Äù.

Money will cover anticipated costs to get Phase 1 pilot plant up and running, including costs of permitting (budgeted $12m just for that‚Ä¶ ouch!).

This is turning out to be a major lithium find in the US‚Ä¶  And don‚Äôt forget the bromine they will also be direct-extracting‚Ä¶ big zinc/bromine batteries for ESS.‚Ä¶ Probably one of the reasons why ASN gave Lilac Solutions the boot and went with SunResin‚Ä¶ Lilac is a one trick pony, currently extracting only lithium.  
ASN is shaping up to be a rare double play. When the final assay results come in for the Phase 2 portion of the project and the JORC is revised, share price should go up significantly.

Note:  Just recently, ASN procured a whopping number of new mineral claims to further expand/secure the scope of their Paradox find‚Ä¶. They don‚Äôt want anybody else siphoning off their resources."
brurtle,imcrt91,ausstocks,2022-08-30 06:00:32,"The major risk is that they don't get project funding. I haven't seen the expected CAPEX required to build Paradox - maybe it will be in the DFS.

They have $5.7M in cash and a $15M loan @5%. Expenses are $3M a quarter so they have 2 years at that rate to secure funding. I think 2 years is pretty good for an exploration company and the US government wants Lithium so I personally give it a low risk of receivership and not getting funding. Their timeline says they aim to secure funding this year so we will know soon and that will derisk it and probably increase the SP again.

Pasha1997,imhvu3v,ausstocks,2022-08-31 08:10:32,Yeh that's true. In my head it was like...if you start a company and have investors etc then you are an experienced business and know what you are doing. It was not the correct way of thinking about it I guess as plenty of people think they are good at something and have a go just to realise they were wrong. But yeh I guess that's why lots of research is the way to go.
_cannotdecide,imh9gjo,ausstocks,2022-08-31 03:44:50,"Yeah i‚Äôm still learning to but one of the first things i learned is it‚Äôs not always as simple as buying at a low and selling at a high. Especially with those low cap miners a lot of the time they have some good sounding news and rocket up and then everyone forgets them and they crash. I prefer to look for those small caps that have something to show, whether it‚Äôs actual results for resources they‚Äôve found or some take off agreements or anything that shows they actually have found something, that way risk is already reduced as they‚Äôve got something to go off. Now that doesn‚Äôt just mean any company that has results bc the next issue would be good/bad results and they don‚Äôt always mean anything if it‚Äôs still a shit company. But hopefully you get where i‚Äôm coming from. 

Also one issue with those micro caps as in i‚Äôm talking &lt;1c is often you‚Äôll see them bounce between maybe 0.5c and 1c for example and you go cool i‚Äôll just buy at 0.5c and double my money when it goes to 1c. The issue is these companies often have very very little trades occurring bc they are complete rubbish and probably just about out of money. So if you buy at the 0.5c there may not actually be any buyers at 1c and sometimes that can drag for months and months and months and is super risky. Just another thing to think about with them."

Don't get me wrong chaotic systems can be modelled the problem is most of the assumptions are typically based on the ""rational market"" model etc. These models don't explain short term volatility very well. There is some interesting research into gauging sentiment (though things like NLP) but there is not a single source of information for stocks it's very hard to gather that information in time.

The main problem is your dealing with memetic theory how an idea mutates and propagates though the public, which is then interpreted by each individual based on a prior (almost always not a Bayesian prior unfortunately, see ""thinking fast and slow"") that determines how they see the future value of the company compared to their fundamentals which they then determine their internal acceptable risk which values the stock. You can see how the meme (the idea) can be shaped and mutated, much like a game of Chinese whispers, and this is shaped by individual and collective beliefs which are very hard to model."

Pasha1997,im8mk56,ausstocks,2022-08-29 10:27:16,I think I see what you are saying. Essentially no one would want to purchase the stock during the peak time.

Look at the charts, Price bounces from 0.05 to 0.06 regularly and looks like an opportunity to make quick money HOWEVER... 

Based in charts alone you may think that you could sell @0.06 as the market does reach these targets however you need a buyer to fulfil the order. And the wait for the market to hit 0.05 and repeat the process... Easy money.

You need to check the market depth to see if there are buyers and what they are willing to pay.

If there is no one wanting to buy at the example price of @0.06 you are stuck with the shares and you will be waiting A LONG TIME for anyone to buy them."

financefiendAU,im39wmo,ausstocks,2022-08-28 04:23:37,"Dicker Data (DDR:ASX) - has a strong revenue and profit growth history, with an equally strong mandate or paying out 100% of profit and increasing dividends over time.

Accenture (ACN:NAS) - increasing market share, strong revenue growth and dominant brand in professional services.

Microsoft (MSFT:NAS) - pretty self-explanatory, just a brilliant business on many metrics. Strongest feature is the growing cloud segment and network effects from their product mix.

Mindful this is very tech heavy, but I personally have strong conviction for these companies. Any thoughts welcome!"

hayjas111,inkvw8c,AusEcon,2022-09-08 12:22:57,"Positive. Go to Kmart and you can buy a kettle for $5, an iron for $5, a microwave for $20. All made in China. For someone here on a low income, being able to afford these things increases their standard of living."
TomasTTEngin,inkexu6,AusEcon,2022-09-08 09:15:20,"if this is an economics subject the answer you're after is as follows: the **benefit** comes to Austraian consumers, who get goods cheaply, made at great economies of scale, by factories - and indeed areas - that specialise in making things and can therefore do good quality at low cost. The idea of specialisation and gains from trade is worth mentioning in this section.

we are all consumers, so this benefit is really big. The evidence for trade's beneificial effects on consumers is huge, and the simplest way to see it is to look at what happens to countries who don't trade: North Koreans starve. Singaporeans(who make nothing but trade hard) eat at michelin star restaurants.

The **downside** is for people who compete with China. Anyone who works in an import-competing industry (or owns capital used in those industries) is at risk of losing their livelihoods / money. Car workers are an example, people who make clothes, certain shelf-stable foods, etc.

This is generally a bigger *individual* impact but less widespread. Most people aren't working in areas that compete with China. arguably the more we specialise in working in areas where we  compete really well with China - trustworthy banks, great english language education, healthy food, the better off we are. starting a sock factory would be a dumb idea, for example."
Wallfacer_1,injv961,AusEcon,2022-09-08 05:04:13,"If you were to do any quantitative analysis the impact would be nonexistent or at most positive. Australia and China are completely different economies in every space including size. Goods and services Australia imports from China cannot be produced here, even if you were to not import these goods from China it would still be cheaper to import them from 10 other countries than to produce in Australia. The point is the relationship between China and Australia is such that both countries export goods and services that they have comparative advantage in producing and vice  versa."
Lower-Ad8330,injtfeq,AusEcon,2022-09-08 04:45:26,Iphones are made in China so China does export decent quality stuff. It is my impression that importers bring in poor quality stuff from China and then mark it up before it reaches the consumer in Australia.

I could maybe make a rough median by stacking the means of professions and choosing the midpoint? but it would be ugly and subject to the same problem, that within any profession you're going to have outliers.

spiderpig_spiderpig_,in75zkp,AusEcon,2022-09-05 16:08:54,"Great. Seems we agree that housing is related to prosperity and given prosperity is a consideration for the RBA, they have a remit to consider housing.

Seems you are saying they choose to deprioritise housing against inflation, which I can‚Äôt fault either, and tend to agree. Inflation left uncontrolled is a disaster.

My concern is over the decades long low rates driving this property boom. They should have lifted rates a long long time ago.

Even in [this speech](https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2021/sp-ag-2021-09-22.html) the RBA bring up low rates a number of times and then ask: what can be done? Any sort of regulation except for increasing rates, apparently."
MrTickle,in6xy96,AusEcon,2022-09-05 15:14:22,"Housing is related to prosperity, and they have plenty of modelling to show the impact of rates on prices. It‚Äôs just no where near as important as inflation, employment and gdp growth and rightly is considered secondarily to those factors when setting monetary policy."
spiderpig_spiderpig_,in6ttxd,AusEcon,2022-09-05 14:45:34,"Nowhere in the act does it specify inflation targeting or that house prices are outside their mandate.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt is the duty of the Board, within the limits of its powers, to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and that the powers of the Bank under this Act, the Banking Act 1959 and the regulations under that Act are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Board, will best contribute to the stability of the currency of Australia; the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.‚Äù

How could they possibly not think that housing and business policy is affected by interest rates? How could they legitimately say that economic prosperity and welfare is unrelated to housing?

It is the RBA who decided their own target measures of inflation to ignore price stability in financial assets and favour consumption items. It is the RBA who decided to drive a housing bubble and then say ‚Äúnot our responsibility‚Äù. The Act clearly guides their scope as more broad than that, and I truly hope they are taken to task for it. What happens next is on them."

TomasTTEngin,in45ikn,AusEcon,2022-09-04 23:00:28,"This is an email from CBA's economist Gareth aArd. He makes an excellent point: monetary policy transmission happens with a lag.

This is potentially a problem when you're hiking so hard. if you overdo it, that's baked in. if you're hiking \*now\* because official infltion data is high, remember that official data was collected in April, May, June, and your hikes won't do anything material until Dec, Jan, Feb. 

Hopefully the RBA has some real-time inflation indicators to help them steer. Otherwise we could be looking at unemployment back up towards 5% by early 2023, and have people sniping at the government when in fact the over-reaction belongs to a past version of the RBA.

&amp;#x200B;

The good news on the economy is that while the RBA fires slow-arcing arrows, fiscal policy can shoot laser beams, moving money in ways that helps spending immediately. Chalmers needs to be ready to balance the scale if the RBA goes too far."

On the other hand, earth has been around for 4 billion years and have seen several cycles of complete destruction along with 4 major extinction events that erased over 90% of the living species. I don‚Äôt think earth gives a shit if we pollute it or not. 

I honestly would be looking at cheapest options. I won‚Äôt go above and behind to create more pollution but I won‚Äôt go above and beyond to not create pollution either. My focus would be to be free and enjoy things instead of worry about things."
xeneks,im2v5yk,AusEcon,2022-08-28 02:09:44,"Plan it better. My planning was bad. You end up regretting it. Spend weeks to months in study to find the lowest impact ways. If you‚Äôre flying, stick a year or more inbetween the journey legs, and do the offsets, and consider what you wear, what you eat. 

My thoughts are that sometimes you have no choice, travel is a rushed affair that‚Äôs destructive; or sometimes you have no inkling or awareness and so travel or tour in destructive ways. 

But on those occasions where you‚Äôre not trapped or a prisoner of circumstances you‚Äôre not easily able to overcome, see if you can 

* travel, reducing land use for human-exclusive or primarily human use, or reducing land used by large dwellings or industry or commerce

* reducing water use, through more carefully selecting the foods you eat, the clothes you wear, the weight you carry.

* reduce pollution, through transportation choices, also through minimising your activities at destinations yo those that are selectively chosen

* take advantage of sharing

Most work robots (people told to travel for work, and their employers) often forget that the consequences of a trip usually have a greater negative or damaging result than whatever good comes from a trip. If however, you‚Äôve the luxury of time and saving, and cooperative people and a comfortable, complimentary attitude, it‚Äôs actually far easier to travel nationally or internationally with low impact. 

Eg. My last trip was thousands of kilometres. I shared transaction data with an organisation that tries to carbon offset every single purchase every time I used my cards. I was selective with what I bought. I didn‚Äôt cram my time in with activities. I tried to extend the trip as long as the people I was with could tolerate. I carbon offset the flights. I purchased as little as I could on the trip. I tried to make use of foods that are lower land use/lower water use. I made use of public transportation. I didn‚Äôt overconsume. etc. 

overall, the trip was still a destructive one. Practically, that trip was damaging, polluting and unnecessary. Yet I did the trip, and constantly considered the costs and in whatever fumbling, incompetent ways I could, I tried to minimise the costs. There‚Äôs a lot of nonsense about ‚Äôdoing‚Äô not ‚Äòtrying‚Äô. But doing usually starts with trying."

xeneks,im2b4hw,AusEcon,2022-08-27 23:25:02,"Given the often destructive environmental effects of travel, especially long distance, it‚Äôs disgusting to focus on travel as a ‚Äòdesirable activity‚Äô. I‚Äôm totally down for low impact travel, but that‚Äôs difficult due to the overall failures of industry to take responsibility for waste streams. Based on my experience, sailing (no ICE, internal combustion engine, or jet engine) internationally isn‚Äôt typical, not are plant based diets, nor is eg. Walking or riding bikes as opposed to driving. Likewise, fashion often has severe environmental consequences. 

These issues are addressable however it‚Äôs depressing to see travel actively marketed without any consideration for the costs in polluted air, water, and land misuse leading to environmentally negligent habitat management, with the outcome being flora and fauna extinctions.

If you search for ‚Äòlow impact tourism‚Äô you get some ideas, but the pollution is less of a focus from the skim of the browser results. In fact, in the full set of returned results searching google on safari on ios, for the three words ‚Äòlow impact travel‚Äô, the word ‚Äòpollution‚Äô didn‚Äôt appear once.

This creates a resentment and animosity towards those who travel long distances for short periods, and creates a self-loathing and depression if you slow down enough in your frantic rush to ‚Äòwork and holiday‚Äô to appreciate that the cost of tourism is massive. Seeking to increase it, to increase pollution, places the employees, shareholders and customers in the position where they face contempt by all except the naive. 

I think carbon offsets are an amazing start. I think electric cars are progress. I think ecotourism is valuable. I think flying is something everyone should experience, as a right, not a luxury. But I think overall too much effort goes to slick marketing and making things look good, seeking the new, and not enough to conservation, protection and pollution management. 

I‚Äôm hoping that industry can make use of new technologies to find their customers from being distinguished by their competence in reducing pollution, through better education. 

I never realised how profoundly the costs of food and beverages, particularly animal products and drugged beverages like alcohol and caffeine, affected the earth. I‚Äôve been a massive part of the problem myself. Yet most restaurants and fast food chains demonstrate limited ability to competently and responsibly guide consumers towards low impact diets. If there were places where I saw competence there, with amazingly tasty low impact foods of excellent nutrition and promoting longevity and health and demonstrating low land, water and energy use and near-zero pollution, I‚Äôd relish travelling there, for long stays, and take my family, and live and love, learn and find joy."

TomasTTEngin,ilzw449,AusEcon,2022-08-27 12:52:32,"If there's 2 million resident departures in a month, that's \~7.5% of the country who aren't here to spend money. If they spend money in Bali and Wellington and NY that's nice for those places but not so great for the great consumption surge that's supposed to drive our economy to fresh highs. 

A realistic assumption might be that the median trip is under a week but the mean overseas trip is longer. Let's say half a month. Call that 7.5% of the country missing for half a month and you're looking at a 3.75% fall in domestic consumption that needs to be offset by tourists. 

From what I gather, however, tourists come, on average, from poorer countries than this one. (this is fairly axiomatic, we are a very rich country) and they don't spend as much as locals each day. They also have a much shorter median holiday ( we are just one of many stops they may make while abroad)  although the average is dragged up by working holiday type travellers who stay for 12 months. 

in short, Aussies going overseas is a big import that might well detract from gdp this year."

older and smaller schemes (many self managed) are likely to maintain no pet bylaws because don't know of these developments

financenerd00,xdy2ub,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-14 10:12:20,Are property prices actually falling in Brisbane?
ZephkielAU,iowp01o,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-18 10:07:57,"I wonder about this, though. There are a number of other factors that generally don't seem to be talked about as much:

1. New builds suck. I'm sure we're all familiar with the state of new units going up, but these mass development kit homes going up everywhere aren't great places to live. Yes you get a modern house, but it's usually poorly optimised for the location (bad drainage, bedroom on one house parked next to the neighbour's toilet, no thought put into the local weather conditions etc). They also tend to attract lower socioeconomic crowds because it's not uncommon to build thousands of houses together, then sell them to early buyers who then rent them out cheap because there's a flood of vacancies. So established homes and suburbs have an inherent appeal to them that people are willing to pay a premium for. For example, try getting polished floorboards or stained-glass windows in a new development zone.

2. Builders consistently collapsing. Between supply issues and massively leveraged development projects, I've yet to see a development zone that doesn't involve people being screwed over on some level.

3. Major rental crisis. There simply aren't enough houses, and the new ones going up suck, if they actually get built.

4. People need to live somewhere. If the bubble pops in the cities, it's because people will be leaving the cities (driving up regional prices). But the cities will always attract people because of work. So even if everyone leaves now for greener pastures, others will come back.

5. Overseeing a housing collapse in Australia is political suicide. The RBA may not care about protecting housing but the government sure does.

I'm not disputing any of the points you made in your post at all, I just think there are more factors than purely economic ones. I definitely agree with you that we'll see prices drop (probably significantly), but I personally believe it's going to be more of a temporary thing*.

*That's if you disregard the gains from the melting upwards of the last few years. I think those are gone, but underneath that I believe there'll be a relatively quick rebound. I'm thinking years rather than months, but I don't see prices hitting a long-term ceiling."
corruptboomerang,iohz32a,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-15 06:19:34,"You really need a third option.

With property ""Prices don't go down"" ... unless they do, then they ""drop like a rock!""

Currently, prices have been stagnant for a while, well they've dropped a little relative to the COVID / post-COVID insane prices. Since the peak in mid-2021 they've dropped by something in the range of 15%-35% (this type of data is always inaccurate, especially when it's about losses). If we compare prices to 2017/2018 type numbers (probably the last time the market was semi-sane, but even they were likely overinflated). The only time you see prices really go down is when people are forced to sell, normally if the market regresses people will hold on rather than sell. I don't think we are at ""drop like a rock"" yet, but current Inflation &amp; Rates are pushing more and more people towards needing to sell. Likely we are in the ""Prices don't go down"" phase. Given the degree of over-inflation, we saw in Brisbane, it's not unlikely we see a significant correction (back towards 'normal' growth from those 17/18 levels), and the way the housing market is structured we could have a bit of a trip and fall correction and see a real decrease.

Currently, the housing market is pretty clearly very over-inflated, but the question is if we will see a return to 'normal growth' or an actual fall. So long as the drop isn't significantly below what the 'normal growth' should be, then we won't get anything crazy, just a reactionary market. But this current market all across Australia is primed for a massive correction. Anything up to a 40% decrease is possible.

Especially if we see any real attempts to rein in some of the causes of the frankly insane property market, (things like negative gearing, black money, GCT discounts, and Family Home exclusion in asset tests,) then we could see a significant correction. But it looks like the current Government has any political apitite to take any real action on this, and is more than happy allowing the market to drift."
DreamHome001,iohy4h5,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-15 06:07:48,"Not necessarily. If you're selling and buying in the same market, it doesn't matter when you sell.

 Thus pushing investors elsewhere at the expense of people looking for a principal place of residence in other states. And the main body of people that move into Australia are moving to Melb/Syd. 

So the implications of this tax will sway people away from buying in QLD which means a QLD property will gain little capital growth comparably.  Meaning a non SC's house is ultimately devalued from what it could have been.

On 30 June 2023, the value of Lena‚Äôs land in Queensland has not changed. But Lena now also owns land in Victoria valued at $1,565,000. The total value of Australian land owned by Lena is $2,310,000, which means the land tax is calculated using a higher rate for individuals.  
  
This is how Lena‚Äôs land tax will be calculated:  
  
Taxable value of Australian land: $2,310,000  
  
Calculation  
= $4,500 + (1.65 cents √ó $1,310,000)  
= $4,500 + $21,615  
= $26,115  
  
This amount is applied to the Queensland portion of Lena‚Äôs land (i.e. ($745,000 √∑ $2,310,000) √ó $26,115)).  
  
We will issue an assessment notice for $8,422.37."

Buy a property close enough to your work to commute and live in it for a least 6 months. This has 2 main advantages: you can declare it your PPOR and avoid CGT contribution for up to 6 years; and you can get a home occupier loan which are usually at a lower interest rate and have fewer conditions.

Then after the PPOR is established, move back in with your parents and rent the property out. You can claim expenses including interest at this point, and still not be liable for CGT."

Positive cashflow allowed me to take a year off work, I saw 23 countries that year and the properties gave me money while I traveled. It‚Äôs very freeing, knowing that I could lose my job tomorrow and my houses are not a liability for me. 

Being young I‚Äôd suggest you consider what cashflow situation you think will compliment the lifestyle that you want. It‚Äôs great that your looking at investing early. But make sure you have a great time through your 20s as well."
OstapBenderBey,io8rudg,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-13 11:22:51,"Your plan is very sound. 

My advice is look at lots of different areas for where you think is both yield (incl. vacancy) and future potential for capital growth. And do the sums to get comfortable you are buying the right thing. And that you can live comfortably if rates go up. Maybe also plan out how many years you expect before you can buy the PPOR you are ballpark thinking of. The more you plan this stuff, even if daunting at first, the more your mind will be at ease in the years to come."
HtAGAnalytics,xcyxvc,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-13 05:22:32,Which brickx property would you buy for maximum capital growth?
jwfacts,io9ps3e,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-13 15:31:37,"I invested in Brickx and bought brickx in a few properties. I sold them about 5 years later, and overall made a small gain. 

Their software platform is impressive, but not the best way to invest. It isn't really like owning a percentage of a house. The gains are distributed yearly and taxed as a trust. 

The drawcard of property investment is the gearing from being able use a 10% deposit to buy a property, and benefit from 100% of the growth. The large gains come when the capital growth exceeds the interest paid on the loan. Banks won't lend money for Brickx and hence the benefit of gearing is lost.  

Their investors seem very capable to choose good properties in any area and I doubt there is much variance between the capital growth of all their properties. With  property, the area/property type determines whether it will have a better annual ROI or capital gain. Brickx seem to pick for a even balance of ROI/Capital Gain, so that the amount borrowed for all properties can guarantee some return each year, along with Capital growth. The loan amount for each property is kept low enough so that the interest and costs do not exceed rent, so that each month there will be some distribution. 

It may have changed, but when I was using it, there wasn't an option to chose between high ROI, or high Capital Growth properties. This makes sense, as they cannot risk having to request money from investors to top up the costs of negatively geared properties. 

Whilst it was nice being able to drive past a property in Mosman and another in Double Bay and say ""I own part of that unit!"" investing shouldn't be motivated by such feelings. For a similar type of investment, my preference (and it may not be good advice) to buy shares in a company that invests in properties. The share price rises based on the value of their property portfolio, and you get yearly dividends. They also do not have the same benefit of gearing that buy a property has, though banks are more inclined to loan a certain percentage to some people for share purchases. 

It would be interesting to compare the return on investing a set amount in Brickx properties, with the same amount invested in an ASX listed company that invests in property.

I have to admit, I did enjoy using Brickx, using their platform, and feeling like I owned several properties around Australia."
20Pippa16,io983a1,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-13 13:37:29,Thanks for explaining.  The family home size houses a reasonable distance from the city would make higher rent wouldn't they?  Although they probably cost more too.  I think you will have to chart the comparison and look at Google maps to work out best value for money.

HtAGAnalytics,io91qlk,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-13 12:51:08,"Thanks! 

The question was more in relation to which property is better positioned to perform in the long run based on the market it's located in.  

Over-valued properties are those that have no bricks for sale at or below the recent valuation price, which has a lag of up to 6 months. So not really a great indicator, as prices may have moved up or down within that period."
20Pippa16,io8p07a,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-13 10:51:36,"I haven't seen this before, it looks really interesting.  Surely though it would make more sense to buy into the ones that are undervalued rather than over?  Eg Kensington, WA or Brunswick, Vic.

actionjj,io7md0r,AusPropertyChat,2022-09-13 03:12:27,"Tax increases required yield for investors, but investors attempt to push up rents, but rent is determined by supply/demand balance. Some of the incidence of the tax will fall to investors, and some to renters. I suspect investors move to alternate investments, property prices reduce very modestly (ceteris paribus), and at the margins, some renters find buying more attractive and will buy. 

Really it's going to have a very, very minor affect. Worrying about this is like being concerned about a stove fire in your kitchen while a bushfire bears down on your back fence. Interest rate rise imoacts on house prices will have a significantly greater impact on prices over the next 24 months."

glyptometa,iovwvq3,ASX,2022-09-18 04:21:30,"37% is way worse than market. Perhaps evaluate your investment plan and re-assess the valuation methods or third party recommendations you used to choose those stocks. That will help you avoid similar troubles as your numbers get bigger throughout your life.

Be realistic. Were they whisper stocks? Online recommendations with little more than paragraphs? Analyst recommendations? Did you miss a bad headwind or shrinking market for their product/service? Did a new more effective competitor come into the picture? Flaky CEO? Did they already have excruciating competition, but you missed it? Did they have extraordinarily high debt? What did their revenue line look like... was it positive and growing? And if so, had they shown ability to capture the increased revenue (growing margin). Were they issuing excessive amounts of new stock? Great learning potential.

How will you know the bottom for the market? What if it turns out to be Monday?

You could and should periodically re-assess individual stocks and decide whether you want to continue holding them, whether they're up, down or sideways. If not, find companies with a better outlook for the future. Once you've found them, sell the laggard and re-deploy your capital.

""Never sell because you lock in a loss"" is bad advice.

If you don't want to analyse and monitor companies, stick to index investing. Read every link on this website: https://passiveinvestingaustralia.com/"

This is a bit of a statement to have you completely rethink your portfolio, nothing wrong with that, but Burry has been predicting the downfall and shorting against the US economy (S&amp;p500) since after GFC. 

There is no doubt that he could be right, but ultimately you have to re-evaluate your holdings and whether over the next few years with current monetary policies which will kick in harder (cash rate) and how this affects your holdings. 

It'd be more beneficial to understand your risk profile, and maybe rethink as well whether the sustainable and speculative style is the right climate for the immediate future."

There are lots of etfs that have the 'set and forget' kind of thing your after. I have done well with STW and IOO. My wife has done well with ETHI. All of these can have their dividends reinvested. There are plenty of others that have specific sectors in mind. If you pick up multiple different etfs, try to avoid to much overlap in their holdings.

You best bet about accounts is to speak to an accountant or your bank if you chooseto use their share trading platform.

embarrasingretard,inaop9y,ASX,2022-09-06 10:22:52,"&gt;Maybe you should have bit the bullet a while ago.

Definitely this. Lockdown and stuff would've had a major hand in increasing the prices

&gt;I‚Äôd expect them to have an earnings per share multiple close to asx or industry average perhaps a little higher given the good growth.

Ahhh tbh I'd argue fluctuations will occur. The ASX is due for a correction (correct me if I'm wrong). I'd need to take a look at the prospectus, but a common trick with investment bankers is that they undervalue the IPOs in the hope of share growth. Again, not saying they have DEFINITELY done that but with that sort of growth my suspicion is that exactly

What we really need to look at are it's cashflow operations and ask if they're sustainable. What are their future plans? Things like that imo. If you're timing the market, things like that prolly won't be necessary but if you're in for time IN the market, then you should look at those things"

bbyg__,ioiwbbw,ASX,2022-09-15 12:54:11,"Even the company themselves somehow expected the sales to continue growing, as if people need a new home office set up every year. They over-forecast sales for TY and as a result all store/assistant managers and team member bonuses have been cancelled. They had enough money to create a few new GM roles though of course."
Slight_Ad3348,imcsd95,ASX,2022-08-30 06:07:33,"You think a single store had that big of an impact on the entire business?

You‚Äôre surprised that sales weren‚Äôt as strong as during covid, the time when they had unprecedented all time company highs? 

The flooded stores aren‚Äôt operational because they intend to demolish them and build new ones which won‚Äôt be affected by flooding. Meanwhile the stores closest to flooded ones are doing record sales because everyone is just driving the extra 15 minutes.

If this is what passes as due diligence I‚Äôd hate to see this subs equivalent of a YOLO into speccy miners."
Neshpaintings,imc4e07,ASX,2022-08-30 02:15:11,You've also gotta consider Bunnings being the highest revenue for Wesfarmers and when floods/fires hit houses are going to need fixing and higher construction.

Neshpaintings,imc3a6k,ASX,2022-08-30 02:06:44,I honestly wasn't too happy about the recent statement either but this had already been priced in ~-20% YTD. but people were expecting it to be alot worse with inflation being negative on clothes for the end of 2021/beginning of 2022.

I would recommend that you do any of these three subjects from the Tax Institute:

* Corporate Tax
* Advanced Superannuation
* Tax for Trusts

When I hire a grad or junior I honestly do not have any expectation as to what they know or don't know. Even the ones with good school grades fail to perform sometimes  for whatever reason.

On the job training is easy but you cannot train someone's personality and you definitely cannot teach common sense. I would rather hire someone who I know would be the best cultural fit and with the right work attitude over their school grades or which school they grad from."

The problem with uni degrees (from the perspective of a public practitioner) is that they give you virtually no real-world skills. Your time and money would be much better spent getting some frontline experience, rather than adding another year of theoretical education. 

If I was recruiting, whether someone had a bachelors or an honours degree would make absolutely no difference to me, their communication and soft skills would be the deciding factor."

iamjello,inkiam5,AustralianAccounting,2022-09-08 10:00:04,"If you're already working in a corporate role, reach out to their finance/accounting department to express your interest - I think this is the easiest way in based on my experience and if you've already built your good rep even better.

Econ degree and landed a job in client servicing team in an advert agency. Realise I hated the social/networking side of the role and applied for an AP role within the same industry (and also agency side). My industry knowledge was quite favourable for the AP role so that's how I've started out. It was a bit of a grind to get recognise in the AP function (a lot of initiative to take on unfavourable work and building relationships with your manager, competitiveness with actual Accounting grads and also bit of politics also) to get the promo to AA, and basically kicked off. 

Based on experience, I believe management accounting would be the easiest to get into. Your work will be accrual and analysis on the P&amp;L against the forecast. You will be presenting these to the stakeholders on the results and provide some insights, so you will need some soft skills for this. 

Doing your grad cert is great for showing initiative and drive in entering the discipline, and CPA/CA is very favourable for large corps. Plenty of corp won't even look at your resume without the 3 letters but there are corps that will consider you (just not as many opportunity to interview, that's all). I'm still on foundation subjects FYI. 
For now getting that AA role is your biggest obstacles now. Make sure you got your accounting concepts down such as double entries, debit/credit, accounting equations etc for your interviews."

I later found out you can do CPA with a different degree, so that‚Äôs something you can look into. If you wanna be a CA, then you have to do some sort of accounting degree before hand

A lot of people keep it to themselves and it can continue to just get much worse.

It feels like the culture within PA is really coming to light lately and more and more I am glad I chose the other route when I had that fork in my career path.

At 18 months you will still be considered a junior. Try and find work in industry, they will appreciate that you have some experience, probably expect that you can at least use excel with basic formulas to reconcile. And that you know your debits and credits. 

Industry is by no means 'maxo relaxo' and in my experience it has been very up and down in stress, but there aren't timesheets everywhere and you will have a lot of different opportunities.

These are my thoughts and experiences anyway."

This is a very good point.

Also worth mentioning that the Tax culture/hourse will likely be different (probably better) to audit.  

In my time, I rarely met a tax person doing equivalent hours to an auditor, let alone more.  The only thing with tax is that it narrows your future career path (which I'm sure you realise)."

AFerociousPineapple,in947el,AustralianAccounting,2022-09-06 00:32:12,"It‚Äôs a complicated issue. Things will have to change in order for firms to attract new staff and retain them in the long run.

But the amount of work required to complete an audit has only increased in the previous 5 years. And most recently ASIC was giving us shit for not doing enough detailed work and when we (the audit industry basically) asked them ‚Äúhey how do improve to meet your standards then?‚Äù They just shrugged their shoulders. The government is a part of the problem here too imo.

Also there‚Äôs the fact of deadlines, say your a midtier firm with a bunch of clients listed on the ASX, they all have to have their financials submitted to the asx by the same date. So if you‚Äôve got multiple clients on the go at once and one gets delayed for some reason that deadline date starts getting harder and harder to meet so you have to do more and more overtime to get shit done. But that‚Äôs the nature of the industry you can‚Äôt just remove deadlines or push them out because let‚Äôs be honest clients will just get lazy, how do I know this? Because I witnessed it during peak covid times when the gov gave listed companies an extension to their deadlines and oh boy did they take it and run."
